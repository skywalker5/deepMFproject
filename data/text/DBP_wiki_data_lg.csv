143576,"Bukkehåmmårtjørna is a small lake in eastern Jotunheimen. This is the highest lake that has been investigated as a climate archive in southern Norway, being situated 1594 m above sea level. A small glacier, Bukkehåmmårbreen, is draining meltwater into the lake at present. This glacier reformed just short of 6,000 years ago following the Holocene climate optimum and has existed continuously since. After growing gradually towards 4,000 years before present (BP) the glacier has been of near present size over the last 4,000 years, growing slightly larger over the last 2-2,500 years. Prior to the climate optimum and following the deglaciation the glacier melted some 10,000 years before present. The flat valley-shoulder that the lake is eroded into is locally known as a \""fly\"". This particular level at about 1600 m a.s.l. and is believed to have been formed between 100 and 85 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. Standing on the shore-line of Bukkehåmmårtjørna thus means that you are standing on the remnants of a landscape that the Dinosaurs ruled. The small lake existed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum since it contains organic material older than 30,000 years old. Currently being reassessed, growing evidence now indicates that much of the landscape that can be seen from this site is practically unchanged since the age of the Mammoth who lived on the wide plateaus more than 40,000 years ago. The view from the lake, or higher up on the mountain-peak Høgdebrotet therefore includes a view into the landscapes of the distant past, including the landscape of the dinosaurs, the pre-ice age landscape, the landscape of the Mammoth during the last glacial period. By squinting your eyes and imagining the present forest-limit below, located some 300 m higher than at present and by imagining the glaciers of Leirungsalpene being absent you can also see the landscape as it was 7,000 years ago.",Place,BodyOfWater,Lake,Bukkehåmmårtjørna,313

155091,"12374 Rakhat, provisional designation 1994 JG9, is an eccentric, stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 15 May 1994, by American astronomer and software engineer Charles de Saint-Aignan at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,487 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.31 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 40 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in May 2010. It gave a rotation period of 18.1702±0.0205 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.31 in magnitude (U=2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.21, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 4.4 kilometers.

Its source is near Tilling Springs to the north of Leith Hill at grid reference TQ143437 and it runs through Friday Street, Abinger Hammer, Gomshall, Shere, Albury, Chilworth and Shalford. The source is a semi-natural uninhabited area. The catchment is situated on sandstone which has a low rate of weathering. The Tillingbourne is 18 km (11 mi) in length. The Tillingbourne initially flows northward for 4 km (2.5 mi) down the northern slopes of Leith Hill over a series of weirs and cascades, before turning west to run for 14 km (8.7 mi) through Abinger Hammer and Chilworth towards the River Wey at Shalford. The river is classified as a subsequent stream, since its course is determined by the direction of the stratum of softer rock for the majority of its length. The river has four principal tributaries: the Friday Street stream joins at Wootton House; the Holmbury St Mary stream joins at Abinger Hammer; the Sherbourne Brook drains the Silent Pool and Sherbourne Pond and the Law Brook joins near Postford. The river used to power a number of gunpowder, paper and flour mills in the area. The gunpowder mill was at Chilworth. Present day users include a trout farm, watercress beds,a business growing reeds and is often studied by students from nearby field studies centres, such as Sayers Croft and Juniper Hall. The river passes through the Albury estate at: Albury Park, Weston fishery, Vale End fishery and Powder Mills fishery. The rivers course has been diverted slightly here for the purpose of the estate. The River Tillingbourne supports a healthy fish population of both wild brown trout and coarse fish. The Environment Agency has been working with local fishermen to improve the habitat for these fish by recreating a pool and riffle habitat and by cutting back overhanging vegetation. The river was championed by the Victorian landscapist Lewis Pinhorn Wood, who lived in Shere from 1884 to 1897, and painted extensively along its banks with scenes including The Silent Pool, Twilight (1888) and Evening on the Tillingbourne (1889).",Place,Stream,River,River_Tillingbourne,366

151902,"Meridian 5 (Russian: Меридиан-5), also known as Meridian No.15L, was a communications satellite launched by the Russian Federal Space Agency which was lost in a launch failure in December 2011. The fifth Meridian spacecraft to be launched, Meridian 5 was to have been deployed into a Molniya orbit with an apogee of 39,000 kilometres (24,000 mi), a perigee of 900 kilometres (560 mi) and 65 degrees of orbital inclination; from which it would have provided communications for the Russian military. It would have been operated by the newly formed Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. Meridian 5 was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with a Fregat upper stage, from Site 43/4 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The launch took place at 12:08 UTC on 23 December 2011, with the rocket performing nominally during first and second stage flight. At 288 seconds after launch, the Blok I third stage's RD-0124 engine ignited to begin its burn. During third stage flight, an anomaly occurred which prevented the rocket from reaching orbit. An official spokesman stated that the launch had been terminated 421 seconds into flight, by means of the rocket's thrust termination system. Telemetry recorded by NPO Lavochkin, however, indicated that the rocket had veered off course 425 seconds after launch, with data suggesting that there had been an explosion. Another report indicated that the engine had lost thrust 427 seconds after launch. It was the first orbital launch to be conducted by the Aerospace Defence Forces, which had been formed at the beginning of the month.

153019,"(6178) 1986 DA is a metallic asteroid, classified as near-Earth object of the Amor group, approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 February 1986, by Japanese astronomer Minoru Kizawa at Shizuoka Observatory, Japan. As an eccentric Amor asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.1901 AU (28,400,000 km) and approaches the orbit of Earth from the outside but does not cross it. It crosses however the orbit of Mars and can be classified as a Mars-crosser and also approaches the orbit of Jupiter within 0.5 AU. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.5 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,732 days). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 9 years prior to its discovery. It was most probably formed from a larger body through a catastrophic collision with another object. Radar measurements of this body indicate that the surface is relatively smooth on scales of less than a meter, but it is highly irregular on scales of 10–100 meters. Several light-curve analysis gave it a concurring rotation period of 3.50 to 3.51 hours with a relatively high brightness amplitude between 0.03 and 0.48 in magnitude, indicating an irregular shape (U=3/3/n.a.). The metallic M-type asteroid is notable for being significantly more radar-reflective than other asteroids. Radar measurements suggest it is composed of nickel and iron and that it was derived from the center of a much larger object that experienced melting and differentiation. The observed radar albedo was 0.58 and the optical albedo was 0.14. According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.08 and 0.16, and a diameter of 3.1 to 3.2 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link selects 3.15 kilometers as best result, while the first estimate from 1994 gave a diameter of 2.3 kilometers. The asteroid achieved its most notable recognition when scientists revealed that it contained over \""10,000 tons of gold and 100,000 tons of platinum\"", or an approximate value at the time of its discovery of \""$90 billion for the gold and a cool trillion dollars for the platinum, plus loose change for the asteroid's 10 billion tons of iron and a billion tons of nickel.\"" In 2012 the estimated value of 100,000 tons of platinum was worth approximately five trillion US dollars.

It is a cave with large caverns, grottos and lakes. The anhydrite has formed gypsum on the surface due to the air moisture in the cave and, as a result, has increased in volume. The resulting layers of gypsum gradually separate from the underlying rock and hang like wallpaper from the walls and ceilings of the underground caverns. It was discovered in 1865 as a gallery was being driven during prospecting work for kupferschiefer, a copper-bearing shale or bituminous marl. By 1866 it had been developed and opened as a show cave under the name of Falkenburg Cave (Falkenburger Höhle). It has a floor area of about 25,000 m². Of interest to visitors are the underground lakes whose gypsum content gives them an iridescent green colour, and a human made stone construction, known as Barbarossa's Table and Chair (Tisch und Stuhl von Barbarossa).

Launched during the Oslo Airport location controversy during the second half of the 1980s, its main purpose was to act as a airport rail link to serve the proposed national airport on Hurumlandet. The main proposal for the line called for a 14-kilometer (8.7 mi) section of double track which would branch from the Spikkestad Line at Hallenskog. Construction of the Hurum Line would have seen 7 kilometers (4.3 mi) of the Spikkestad Line upgraded to double track as well as upgrades to the Drammen Line. The distance from Hurum to Oslo is 45 kilometers (28 mi), with travel time estimated at 35 minutes. Alternative proposals were also made, such as building a bridge over the Oslofjord and connecting it to the Østfold Line, or the use of coaches and hovercraft. There were also proposals for a monorail and a maglev service. The new airport was in 1992 instead chosen to be located at Gardermoen, resulting in the construction of the Gardermoen Line and the abandonment of any plans for building a railway to Hurum.",Place,RouteOfTransportation,RailwayLine,Hurum_Line,195

It was discovered on 25 June 1987, by Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos at South Bohemian Kleť Observatory in the Czech Republic. The C-type asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, the most prominent family of otherwise stony asteroids in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,550 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 15° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1951, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 36 years prior to its discovery. In February 2008, a photometric light-curve analysis by Slovak astronomer Adrián Galád at the Modra Observatory gave a rotation period of 4.171±0.003 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 in magnitude (U=3). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 (which is typical for stony asteroids and contradicts its C-type classification) and calculates a diameter of 9.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.5. Alternatively, based NASA's generic magnitude-to-size conversion table, and assuming a rather typical albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.05, the body's diameter would increase to 19 kilometers. The minor planet was named in memory of American actor and dancer James Cagney (1899–1986), remembered best for playing multifaceted tough guys in movies such as The Public Enemy (1931) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938).

Finley is a 126 bed, non-profit hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and has been licensed by the state of Iowa. In 2016, Finley Hospital welcomed patients to a multi-phase project that provides a 70,000 square foot, 3-story addition located on the Grandview Avenue side of the current Finley Hospital building. The building houses the Emergency Department, surgical suites and Heart and Vascular Center, improving health care delivery for the community. History The hospital was founded in 1890 when Mrs. Helen Finley bequeathed her estate towards the founding of a hospital in memory of her husband Dr. John Finley. Dr. Finley was Dubuque's first general physician and the second permanent physician of both the county of Dubuque and the state of Iowa. He had the reputation for being a kind man with a deep, invested interest in his patients. This was a well-earned reputation, for Dr. Finley would travel many miles by horseback to attend to patients in surrounding areas and would even help with household chores before getting back on the saddle and traveling to another patient in need. He and his wife were very active within the Dubuque community, belonging to the early settlers group, helping to organize the Presbyterian Church, and forming the Northwest Medical Society (currently known as the Dubuque County Medical Society.) Dr. Finley always wanted to establish a medical school and a hospital. Unfortunately, his efforts to do so were unsuccessful and he eventually died before he could see his dreams come to fruition. Helen helped to honor one of her deceased husband's two wishes. In her will and testament, she specified that her estate should be used to found a hospital in Dubuque named after her husband.

It was discovered on 5 October 1997, by Czech astronomer Zdeněk Moravec at the South Bohemian Kleť Observatory in the Czech Republic. The dark C-type asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,091 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was made at the Japanese Kiso Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 20 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in December 2012. It gave it a rotation period of 4.4692±0.0019 hours with a brightness variation of 0.24 in magnitude (U=2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 12.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.097, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.08 and calculates a diameter of 7.9 kilometers.

Prior to mining operations commencing there, the mountains were heavily forested with large Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii glauca) and other conifers, but these were all cut down for housing needs and to feed the ore smelting furnaces in Douglas, Arizona, approximately 20 miles due east. Now, the primary vegetation of the Mules consists of manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) brush, juniper, lowland oaks and pines, and various grasses. To the east of the mountain range lies Sulphur Springs Valley, and the San Pedro River and Valley to the west. The terrain is very rough, with very steep slopes descending into deep canyons. Common wildlife species include Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), White-tailed deer (O. virginianus), Collared Peccary (Pecari tajacu) (locally known as javalinas), various types of rodents, lizards and a wide variety of birds. The upper ridges of the mountains consist primarily of a very hard brecciate limestone, and it is very common to find fossils of clams and snails imbedded in them. Immediately to the east central area of the Mules lies the Lavender Pit, a large and very deep open pit copper mine dug and mined by the Phelps Dodge Corporation between 1951 through 1974. Over a billion tons of copper were extracted from the mine, along with significant quantities gold, silver and lead. Also, as a by-product of the mining operations, high quality turquoise (locally known as Bisbee Blue) was also discovered. On the east central slope of the Mule Mountains can be found the Copper Queen Mine. In its days of production, (late 19th century – early 20th century) it was the richest copper deposit ever discovered, causing the accompanying town of Bisbee, Arizona to prosper, becoming the largest city between St. Louis in the east, and San Francisco in the west for a short while. Under this part of the Mule Mountains are many mining tunnels dug in pursuit of the rich copper ore. Today, Bisbee (also known as the \""mile-high city,\"" at elevation 5,300 ft or 1,600 m) is largely a tourist town and retirement community along the slopes of Tombstone Canyon in the heart of the Mules.

NICER will enable rotation-resolved spectroscopy of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2–12 keV) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known. NICER will achieve these goals by deploying, following launch, an X-ray timing and spectroscopy instrument as an attached payload aboard the International Space Station (ISS). NICER was selected by NASA to proceed to formulation phase in April 2013. An enhancement to the NICER mission, the Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology (SEXTANT), will act as a technology demonstrator for X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV) techniques that may one day be used for deep-space navigation. As of May 2015, NICER was on track for a 2016 launch, having passed its critical design review and resolved an issue with the power being supplied by the ISS.

The bridge's design, which lacked shoulders for disabled or wrecked vehicles to pull out of the flow of traffic, made it a severe bottleneck for commuters going to the Orlando Area beginning in the 1980s. A series of fatal traffic collisions on it and similarly-designed bridges statewide, most notably the Interstate 75 Lake Panasoffkee Bridge, led to a move in 2000 to use state emergency bridge funds similar to the contingency funds used to rebuild the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to begin planned reconstruction.

The lake area covers 4,370 hectares, and its depth reaches 196 meters, making it one of the deeper lakes in Turkey, if not the deepest. It is a popular excursion spot across the region or from beyond, the more so due to the hydromagnesite mineral found along its coasts which are believed to offer remedies for certain dermatological diseases. The shoreline surrounded by black pine forests are also popular among hunters, the game and the fowl available including quails, hares, foxes, boars and wild ducks, aside from the lake's fish. White sandy beaches, limpid water and seven crystal-white islets within the lake complete the scenery.

Located in the Goose Hollow neighborhood, the tunnels pass through a hillside locally known as Vista Ridge which is a half mile (1 km) west of downtown Portland. Sunset Highway, also known as U.S. Route 26, is carried through the tunnels, three lanes in each direction. They are Oregon's busiest tunnels. The eastbound tunnel is 1001.0 feet (305 m) in length; the westbound tunnel is 949 feet (289 m). Both have 41 ft (12.5 m) of horizontal and 15.58 ft (4.75 m) of vertical clearance. The eastbound tunnel was completed in 1969, the westbound a year later. There is a six-percent grade through the tunnels. Most of the tunnels' lengths are straight, though they curve southward at the west ends 35°. The tunnels were built with ventilation shafts which were never used. Instead, the shafts were later adapted for electrical wiring, so as to improve tunnel illumination without marring the tunnels' appearance with visible conduit. To improve tunnel safety for motorists, and decrease the tunnel lighting requirements, the original tunnel entrance faces were sandblasted to remove white paint and repainted a less luminescent tan color to reduce the range of visual light adaptation required by drivers. At one time there were computer-based electronic light controls, but they were replaced by relatively simple photo detectors and relays for durability and simplicity. The night lighting level is enabled permanently and is supplemented by two or three levels of daytime lighting. Except directly over the tunnels, the hillsides are steep and undeveloped forest, with some residential development along the top of the ridges. Landslides occasionally occur, but are usually minor and quickly cleared.

153054,"1868 Thersites, provisional designation 2008 P-L, is a carbonaceous Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately 70 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch-American astronomer Tom Gehrels at the U.S. Palomar Observatory, California, on 24 September 1960. On the same day, the group discovered another Jupiter trojan, 1869 Philoctetes. The dark C-type asteroid is orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.9 AU once every 12.27 years (4,482 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 17° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 6 years prior to its discovery. In 1994, photometric observations of this asteroid were made by Stefano Mottola at ESO's La Silla Observatory, Chile, using the Dutch 0.9-metre Telescope. The observations were used to build a light-curve showing a rotation period of 10.416±0.014 hours with a brightness variation of 0.14±0.01 magnitude (U=2+). According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid's diameter measures 78.9 and 68.2 kilometers, respectively, with a low albedo of 0.055 for its surface. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057, and calculates a shorter diameter of 66.9 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 9.6. The provisional survey designation \""P-L\"" stands for Palomar–Leiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s and 1970s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Cornelis and Ingrid van Houten at Leiden Observatory, where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of 4,620 minor planets. The Trojan asteroid is named from Greek mythology after Thersites, a Greek warrior who wanted to abandon Troy's siege during the Trojan War and head home. The given name also refers to the fact, that the asteroid was discovered farthest from the L4 Lagrangian point.

However, scorn from players continued, with the course consistently ranking near the bottom on the PGA Tour's annual player poll ranking the Tour's venues. Each year, one or two top players would routinely skip the event. This issue came to a head in 2014, when Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott (three of the top 4 players in the world at the time) all chose to skip the event, with Scott in particular saying he would be more likely to play if the event were staged at a different course.

153866,"1980 Tezcatlipoca, provisional designation 1950 LA, is an eccentric, stony asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Amor group of asteroids, approximately 6 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 19 June 1950, by American astronomer Albert G. Wilson and Swedish astronomer Åke Wallenquist at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The S-type asteroid is classified as a Sw-type by the ExploreNEOs project, and as a SU and Sl-type on the Tholen and SMASS taxonomic scheme, respectively. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.1–2.3 AU once every 2 years and 3 months (817 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.36 and an inclination of 27° with respect to the ecliptic. Its Earth minimum orbit intersection distance is slightly less than 0.245 AU (36,700,000 km), which corresponds to 95.3 lunar distances. Between 1988 and 2015, five rotational light-curves were obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations and gave a well-defined, concurring rotation period of 7.25 hours with a brightness variation between 0.22 and 1.01 in magnitude, indicative of a non-spheroidal shape (U=3/n.a./2+/3-/n.a.). According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures between 4.5 and 6.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.128 and 0.247. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the revised NEOWISE observations, that is, an albedo of 0.128 and a diameter of 6.0 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.96. The asteroid was named after Tezcatlipoca, the Aztech deity of matter, whose name translates to \""Smoking Mirror\"" in the Nahuatl language. His animal counterpart was the jaguar and his contender was Quetzálcoatl, after which the minor planet 1915 Quetzálcoatl is named.

It is line 0 (zero) of the Belgian rail network. With 1200 trains a day it is the busiest railway line in Belgium and the busiest railway tunnel in the world. It has six tracks and is used principally for passenger trains. It is partially underground (around Brussels Central station) and partially raised above street level. The idea of an underground railway line linking the city's two main railway stations was first suggested in the 1860s as part of a proposal for the covering of the Senne. That proposal was never effected. The current version was planned before World War II, after a decision originally made in 1909, and it came into service on 5 October 1952. The stations on the line, from north to south, are: \n* Brussels North (French: Bruxelles-Nord (STIB: Gare du Nord), Dutch: Brussel-Noord (MIVB: Noordstation)) \n* Brussels Congress (French: Bruxelles-Congrès, Dutch: Brussel-Congres) \n* Brussels Central (French: Bruxelles-Central (STIB: Gare Centrale), Dutch: Brussel-Centraal (MIVB: Centraal Station)) \n* Brussels Chapel (French: Bruxelles-Chapelle, Dutch: Brussel-Kapellekerk) \n* Brussels South (French: Bruxelles-Midi (STIB: Gare du Midi), Dutch: Brussel-Zuid (MIVB: Zuidstation)) (the Eurostar, Thalys, TGV and ICE international terminal) Most national (inter-city and local) trains that use the line stop at North, Central and South stations. The international Thalys, Eurostar and TGV services stop only at the international terminal of Brussels South. ICEs have an additional stop at Brussels North. Congress and Chapel stations are served only by a limited number of trains during weekday working hours. The line is used by very few freight trains. To avoid further congestion, most freight traffic crossing between the north and south of Brussels is routed instead along either line 26, to the east (Halle to Vilvoorde, via Merode), or along line 28, to the west (Brussels South to Bockstael railway station via Brussels-West station and Simonis). The stations of Brussels North and Brussels South are also linked by the premetro north-south axis, which runs through the city centre to the west of the railway line.

126801,"Belmond Palacio Nazarenas is a hotel in a former convent built on Inca walls at the centre of Cusco, Peru. It is located in a small square close by the Plaza de Armas and the city cathedral. The hotel stands on the site of a former Inca building and reuses stones that may have been used in the original construction. Shortly after the new building’s completion as a private home in the mid 1500s it had a succession of owners, including the famous warrior and gambler Mancio Serra de Leguizamón. In 1644 the Jesuits acquired the property and used it as a school. In 1650 Cusco suffered a devastating earthquake and the building required extensive repairs. It continued as a school until 1673, before being sold to a private owner in 1687. In 1715 it was turned into “beaterio”, a type of convent for what was considered to be a “lower order” of nuns. Its occupants came from families of the native aristocracy, rather than immigrant Spanish clergy. The nuns never received the level of funding enjoyed by the “higher orders”, and therefore the building’s fabric remained simple at best. A church was built within the complex, which the public were allowed to visit. On such occasions the nuns sat in screened enclosures that still stand today. Although this church is no longer permanently consecrated it is still used for religious worship, weddings and secular gatherings. A mezzanine area above the church is now used as a library with a display of artifacts discovered during recent restoration. One of the former nuns’ cells has a fresco of Christ, known as the Lord of Huanca, which has always been highly venerated by the people of Cusco. It has recently been restored by distinguished art restorer Julio Ninantay. The nuns ran an orphanage within their complex and also made marzipan delicacies for sale to raise funds. Transactions were conducted via a turntable so that neither seller nor purchaser need see one another. This device can still be seen at the hotel’s entrance. Many early frescoes were painted on the walls of the complex, a number of which remain and have been restored. A fountain sits at the centre of the main courtyard, with Inca-style water channels running from it. One of the hotel’s suites, thought to have once been the Mother Superior’s quarters, has a coffered ceiling painted with pink roses. Other rooms contain features such as Inca-style niches and brick arches. In 1876 a girls’ boarding school and a lower school for “young women of scarce resources” were introduced. In 1961 the Nazarenes dissolved their order into that of the Carmelites and the number of nuns living in the building reduced. By 1977 the last ones had moved out and the building was leased to the Peruvian government agency Plan Copesco, with the aim of restoring it. Plan Copesco left the building in 1997 and in 1999 the lease was transferred to Orient-Express Hotels. Following a complex restoration project it opened as Palacio Nazarenas in 2012. The hotel has the first outdoor swimming pool in Cusco, a spa and a restaurant that uses herbs and vegetables grown in the hotel’s gardens. In 2014 the company changed its name to Belmond Ltd.

111705,"The Malabadi Bridge (Turkish: Malabadi Köprüsü, Kurdish: Pira Malabadê‎) is an arch bridge spanning the Batman River near the town of Silvan in southeastern Turkey. Construction began in the year AH 541 (1146/1147) during the Artuqid period, and appears to have been completed in AH 549 (1154/1155). The bridge was commissioned by Temür-Tash of Mardin, son of Ilghazi, and grandson of Artuk Bey. According to the local 12th-century historian Ibn al-Azraq al-Farīqī, the current bridge replaced one built in AH 48 (668/669) that had collapsed in AH 539 (1144/1145). Inconsistencies between the two surviving manuscript copies of Ibn al-Azraq's account make it difficult to definitively identify the Malabadi bridge as the one he refers to as the Qaramān or Aqramān bridge. Nevertheless, many aspects of his geographical description and historical account support this identification. Ibn al-Azraq says that construction of the current bridge was initiated by the Artuqid ruler of Mayafaraqin and Mardin al-Saʿīd Ḥusām al-Dīn Temür-Tash in AH 541 (1146/1147), under the supervision of al-Zāhid bin al-Ṭawīl. After al-Zāhid had built the bridge's eastern footing it was destroyed by floods. Al-Zāhid was fined for \""defective craftsmanship\"" and replaced by Amir Saif al-Dīn Shīrbārīk Maudūd bin ʿAlī (bin Alp-Yaruq) bin Artuq. Shīrbārīk restarted the work under the supervision of Abuʾl-Khair bin al-Ḥakīm al-Fāsūl, who used massive timbers in the construction. By AH 548 (1153/1154) the bridge was nearly finished. And yet, at the time of the death of Ḥusām al-Dīn Temür-Tash on 2 Dhuʾl-Qaʿda 548/18 January 1154, the arch was not yet complete. His successor, Najm al-Dīn Alpī, set about completing the bridge, and, although work was again interrupted by flooding, \""[h]e built and repaired it and completed the joining of the arch.\"" The French architectural historian Albert Gabriel and epigraphist Jean Sauvaget visited the bridge in 1932 and Sauvaget discerned an inscription in the name of Temür-Tash with the year AH 542 (1147/1148), which possibly corresponds to the start of the second construction under Shīrbārīk. The bridge was restored in the late twelfth century, and recently in the beginning of the 20th century. It was once the only bridge across the river in this area, and was in continuous use until the 1950s, when a new road bridge was opened upstream. The span of the bridge crosses perpendicular to the river, but the roadway is at an angle to the river, so there are angular breaks in the east and west approaches. The approaches rise from ground level to meet the central span, which is a pointed arch high over the deepest part of the river. Constructed from colored solid masonry, the approaches have small arches built into them to let flood-waters through. Two of the piers of the bridge sit in the river; the western support is decorated with two carved figures, one standing and one sitting. The bridge is 150 m (160 yd) long and 7 m (23 ft) wide, 19 m (62 ft) in height and a main span of 38.6 m (127 ft). The roadway has two toll-booths, one either side of the main span.

153570,"2865 Laurel, provisional designation 1935 OK, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by English-born South African astronomer Cyril Jackson at Johannesburg Observatory on 31 July 1935. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.4–2.7 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,497 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. No precoveries were taken and the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery observation in 1935. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini in September 2005. It gave a longer than average rotation period of 21.5±0.3 hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 in magnitude (U=2). According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures between 14.7 and 25.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.09 and 0.22. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with IRAS and derives an albedo of 0.24 and a diameter 14.8 kilometers. The minor planet was named after English-born comedian Stan Laurel (1890–1965).

129008,"The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, also known as The Restaurant, Restaurant Marco Pierre White and later Oak Room Marco Pierre White, was a restaurant run by chef proprietor Marco Pierre White. The restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel, London, on 14 September 1993, having previously wished to find a larger premises than his restaurant Harveys to seek a third Michelin star. In moving, the kitchen staff was more than doubled in number, and White used Pierre Koffman's La Tante Claire as a template to pursue his third star. This was awarded in the 1995 Michelin guide. White then moved the restaurant to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, London, in 1997, taking on the listed Oak Room as the main dining room. He sought a further rating of five red knives and forks in the guide, to gain the highest possible rating for the restaurant. It gained this award in the following guide. When White retired in December 1999, he handed the Michelin stars back, but under Robert Reid it won a single star again in the 2001 and 2002 editions of the guide before closing later that year. During the course of The Restaurant's two locations, White sought to develop the techniques used in the dishes and expand the range of food on offer. The space used at Harveys was inadequate for his plans, but with the Hyde Park Hotel location he was able to add elements which were braised or made confit. At the Oak Room, both chickens and lamb were cooked each day just for pressed juices with which to make sauces for other dishes. The Restaurant was critically acclaimed, with critics such as Michael Winner, A. A. Gill and Jonathan Meades praising the food served.

141633,"Lake Ouachita (Pronounced WAH-shi-tah) is a reservoir created by the damming of the Ouachita River by Blakely Mountain Dam (34°34′21″N 93°11′39″W﻿ / ﻿34.57250°N 93.19417°W). Blakely Mountain Dam was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1948 to 1953 for hydroelectric power, recreation, water supply and wildlife conservation. The dam is 231 feet tall, 1,100 feet long at the crest, and is capable of 75 megawatts. The lake is located near Hot Springs, Arkansas. Lake Ouachita is the largest lake completely in Arkansas, as the larger Bull Shoals Lake extends into Missouri. Lake Ouachita has over 690 miles (1,110 km) of shoreline and over 40,000 acres (16,000 ha) of water. It is completely surrounded by the Ouachita National Forest. Lake Ouachita is located near two other lakes, Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine. These three lakes, DeGray Lake to the near south, and the thermal springs of Hot Springs National Park make Hot Springs a popular tourist getaway. Largemouth Bass, Small Mouth Bass, Spotted Bass, Bream, Crappie, Catfish, Walleye and world class Trophy Striped Bass await the angler. Lake Ouachita is known as the Striped Bass Capital of the World.Lake Ouachita has many unusual features. One feature by the Corps of Engineers is the Geo-Float Trail, a marked trail which can be followed with a brochure which details prominent geologic features along the route. Lake Ouachita also features one of the largest crystal veins in the world. Lake Ouachita has rare jellyfish (non-stinging) and sponges found in only very few of the cleanest freshwater lakes. Scuba divers from all over the world enjoy the underwater experience as well as the special spear fishing season. The original purpose of Lake Ouachita was flood control and hydroelectricity. Another topic of debate is the vegetation that covers 10% of the lake. Lake Ouachita's vegetation is being addressed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, and the Lake Ouachita Association to control the hydrilla and Eurasian watermilfoil. The goal of the project is to contain and reduce — not to eradicate — the vegetation, since the presence of aquatic vegetation in moderate amounts is beneficial to the lake's fishery. Treatment will be concentrated on high recreational use areas, such as swimming beaches, around marinas and popular boating areas. Areas of the lake containing good fishery habitat will not be treated.",Place,BodyOfWater,Lake,Lake_Ouachita,393

153481,"12621 Alsufi, provisionally designated 6585 P-L, is a carbonaceous Themistian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels at the U.S. Palomar Observatory, California. It is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical group of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. The C-type asteroid is also classified as a rather rare L-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' large-scale survey. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,000 days). Its orbit is tilted by 2° to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.13. No precoveries were taken prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory, California, in January 2012. It gave a rotation period of 4.7194±0.0024 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.71 in magnitude (U=2). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.08 and calculates a diameter of 6.8 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 14.21. The survey designation \""P-L\"" stands for Palomar–Leiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of 4,620 minor planets. The minor planet is named in honor of 10th-century Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (A.D. 903–986), also known by his western name, Azophi. Working in Isfahan, he produced his influential star atlas around A.D. 963. The atlas is based on both, Ptolemy's Almagest and on pre-Islamic star lore, and contains the earliest description of the Andromeda Galaxy.

It is also one of the major rivers of Asia that cuts through 4 countries: China, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh. As such, it is known by various names in the region. In (Assamese: ব্ৰহ্মপুত্ৰ নদী) Brôhmôputrô); Hindi: ब्रह्मपुत्र, IAST: Brahmaputra; Tibetan: ་, Wylie: yar klung gtsang po Yarlung Tsangpo; simplified Chinese: 布拉马普特拉河; traditional Chinese: 布拉馬普特拉河; pinyin: Bùlāmǎpǔtèlā Hé. It is also called Tsangpo-Brahaputra (when referring to the whole river including the stretch within Tibet), and the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. The Manas River that runs through Bhutan joins it at Jogighopa, in India. It is the tenth largest river in the world by discharge, and the 29th longest. With its origin in the Angsi glacier, located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo River, it flows across southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh (India), where it is known as Dihang or Siang. It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be mistaken with Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganga Delta, it merges with the Padma, the popular name of the river Ganga in Bangladesh, and finally the Meghna and from here it is known as Meghna before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. About 1,800 mi (2,900 km) long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation. The average depth of the river is 124 ft (38 m) and maximum depth is 380 ft (120 m). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in spring when the Himalayan snows melt. The average discharge of the river is about 19,300 m3/s (680,000 cu ft/s), and floods can reach over 100,000 m3/s (3,500,000 cu ft/s). It is a classic example of a braided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion. It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit a tidal bore. It is navigable for most of its length. The river drains the Himalaya east of the Indo-Nepal border, south-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai-Bum hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet, is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only peak above 8,000 m, hence is the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin. The Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is often called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river. The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means \""son of Brahma\"" in Sanskrit (putra means \""son\"").",Place,Stream,River,Brahmaputra_River,490

150324,"NGC 5585 is a spiral galaxy located about 28 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major and is a member of the M101 Group of galaxies. The galaxy has a diameter of about 35,000 light-years and has a very diffuse disc with almost no central bulge. Although its overall structure is quite complex, the galaxy does have a very faint spiral arm structure which has resulted in it receiving a galaxy morphological classification of SAB(s)d. Like other galaxies with a similar type, NGC 5585 exhibits a moderate level of star formation that is mostly concentrated in the central region. To date, 47 distinct regions of star formation have been identified. Despite this, the galaxy's visible components appear to form only a tiny fraction of the total mass present as the gravity of the visible portion of the disc does not explain the observed rotation curve even extremely close to the center. This suggests that NGC 5585 has a very large dark matter component that is more reflective of what is normally seen in dwarf galaxies than a galaxy of this size. Even the gravity of the galaxy's H I regions appears to have more impact than the visible components of the galaxy. A total of five supernova remnants (SNRs) have been observed in NGC 5585 to date. One of the SNRs is extremely large with dimensions of about 200 x 90 parsecs (650 x 300 ly) and its x-ray emissions are so powerful that it actually distorted the initial x-ray emission contour map for the entire galaxy that was obtained by the Einstein Observatory in the early 1980s. The SNR's large size and the fact that it is still expanding at an abnormally high rate of more than 85 km/s (53 mi/s) suggest that it is probably located in a low-density area of NGC 5585's interstellar medium.

Also housing the Tennessee State Museum, the cultural center adjoins the 18-story James K. Polk State Office Building. The idea for a large-scale performing arts facility developed in 1972 when Martha Rivers Ingram was appointed to the advisory board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. She proposed a similar center for her home city of Nashville. Ingram's proposal involved a public-private partnership that would operate within a state-owned facility. Her idea met with considerable resistance, but she persevered—for eight years and during the terms of three governors. The result was the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, a three-theater facility located beneath a state office building across the street from the Tennessee State Capitol. In 1980, TPAC opened as the state's premier theater venue. Among its many operations, TPAC presents a series of touring Broadway shows and special engagements, and administers a comprehensive education program. Martha Rivers Ingram and her supporters also raised an endowment to defray operating losses and to fund a program that grooms future audiences for TPAC performances. The endowment goal was $3.5 million, and they surpassed it, raising $5 million. Today, the endowment has grown to $20 million. Each year, more than 100,000 students, from kindergarten through 12th grade, are brought to Nashville for performances by Nashville Ballet, the Nashville Opera, and the Tennessee Repertory Theatre, which are all resident performing arts groups of TPAC and provide year-round programming.

When the Imperial Japanese attacked Darwin and Broome in 1942 resulting in the loss of 16 flying boats, the establishment of a safe haven for flying boats was required inland as a remote facility outside the sphere of Japanese airplanes. Lake Boga was picked as it allowed almost unlimited choice of landing/take off directions and was free of obstructions. It was also close to nearby infrastructure. Required for Australian, Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force and United States flying boat servicing and repairs, Lake Boga was commissioned in June 1942. No. 1 Flying Boat Repair and Service Depot was set up to provide the repair and servicing requirements. Lake Boga was recommended by Squadron Leader Gareth O'Brien since he was familiar with the area having grown up in Kerang. Of note, Myles O'Brien (Father to Gareth) was the local solicitor and owned the first auto-mobile in Kerang. SQN leader Gareth O'Brien saw service with the Royal Naval Air Service in Yorkshire UK in the late 1920s and Cairo, Egypt in the early 1930s. Being an avid photographer of that time he took many black and white photographs that still exist and have been published in some historical publications. Flight Lieutenant (at the time) Gareth O'Brien was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for dropping two bombs from his aircraft on a submarine in the English Channel, 6 March 1918. A direct hit was reported by the observer and it was thought to have sunk but SQN Leader O'Brien, in a letter to his Father, thought he perhaps only gave it a 'shake up'. Facilities constructed at the base included workshops and hangars on the foreshore, a stores area, living quarters, sick quarters at Castle Donnington, a first-aid and dental post, a radio transmitting station and a VHF transmitting station. Flying boats serviced, repaired, restored, rebuilt or overhauled during the operation of the base were PBY Catalina, Dornier Do 24, OS2U Kingfisher, Short Sunderland, Supermarine Walrus and Martin Mariner. The station at Lake Boga closed in November 1947. The underground Communications Bunker has been transformed into the Flying Boat Museum.

Good roads advocate and road-building pioneer Sam Hill was perhaps the main motivating force behind building the original Pacific Highway as a \""national auto trail\""; from Blaine, Washington, on the Canada–US border, where he would build his Peace Arch, through Oregon to the Siskiyou Mountains of northwestern California. The road was built in the early 20th century—long before the U.S. Highway System was established. In 1923, its 1,687 miles (2,715 km) of pavement made it the longest continuous stretch of paved road in the world at the time. The Pacific Highway later extended north to Vancouver, British Columbia, and south through San Francisco to San Diego in Southern California. The Pacific Highway auto trail became British Columbia Highway 99 from Vancouver to the Canada–United States border, U.S. Route 99 from the border to Red Bluff, California, in the Sacramento Valley; U.S. Route 99W from Red Bluff to Davis, California, in the Central Valley; U.S. Route 40 from Davis to San Francisco; and U.S. Route 101 from San Francisco to San Diego. This alignment is now mostly Interstate 5 in California, except between Woodland, California, and Los Angeles, where it uses State Route 113, Interstate 80 and then U.S. Route 101. In Oregon, Interstate 5 is now officially the Pacific Highway No. 1 (see Oregon highways and routes). First completed in 1923, Oregon's Pacific Highway was the first border to border paved highway west of the Mississippi River.

In spite of being a short river, its drainage basin is the seventh-largest in the country due to the great size of the O'Higgins/San Martín Lake, its source. The Pascua River was discovered in 1898 by the German Hans Steffen, during the exploration of the area near Christmas time (Pascua means Easter but is frequently used to describe Christmas in Chilean Spanish, thus explaining the origin of its name). The river has its source in the northern part of the north-west arm of the lake O'Higgins in the form of a small stream, in an area surrounded by steep-sided mountains that reach over 1,000 meters with glaciers spilling down to the lake or to the river. The river flows quickly forming rapids until to create a cascade in the place where it falls into the Chico Lake. After leaving this lake, the river forms a new cascade and rushes furiously, preventing any type of navigation on its waters. Then the river is joined by the \""Quiroz River\"" from the left, whose origin is the glacier of the same name, increasing its width in a valley of about 10 kilometers wide, which allows the development of large meanders and some marshy and peaty zones. After 62 km, the Pascua River ends in a wide delta that empties into the Baker Channel, previously having rushed in a last area of rapids. Due to its hydrographic conditions, the Pascua River has a hydroelectric potential of great importance.

143605,"New Bullards Bar Reservoir is a large reservoir in northeastern Yuba County, California, at an elevation of 2,000 feet (610 m) in the Tahoe National Forest and about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Yuba City, California. The 969,600 acre foot (1.1960×109 m3) reservoir is formed by New Bullards Bar Dam on the North Yuba River, a tributary of the Sacramento River. It also receives a portion of the Middle Fork's flow that is diverted to the reservoir via tunnels. The dam is a 635-foot (194 m) high concrete variable radius arch dam. It was finished in 1970 and is owned by the Yuba County Water Agency. It is a multipurpose dam, but its most important function is flood control, which 170,000 acre feet (210,000,000 m3) of the reservoir's capacity is dedicated to. While this is only 17.5% of the reservoir's total capacity, it is enough to create a medium-sized reservoir by itself. The dam also provides water for irrigation, hydroelectricity production and recreation, including boating, water skiing, fishing and camping. The reservoir provides water to power two hydroelectric plants, New Colgate Powerhouse and Fish Release Powerhouse. New Colgate Powerhouse is not located at the base of the dam, like most hydroelectric plants. Instead, the 14-foot (4.3 m) diameter New Colgate Tunnel carries the water about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of the dam to the powerhouse. This increases the head, which allows the plant to produce more electricity. The dam's Pelton wheels are the largest ever built and have a combined capacity of 315 MW. Some water is released at the base of the dam so that the streambed is not completely dewatered upstream of the New Colgate Powerhouse tailrace. This water powers the 150 kW Fish Release Powerhouse. In the event of a power outage, this plant can operate the dam's massive spillway gates. Bullards Bar Reservoir is also used for outdoor recreation. It is 16 miles (26 km) in length and has 60+ miles of shoreline. Water Ski Magazine rates Bullards Bar Reservoir as one of the best recreational lakes in the United States. Bullards Bar offers two boat launching facilities with one launch ramp adjacent to Emerald Cove Marina. Emerald Cove Marina offers a variety of services, such as a general store, gasoline, boat moorage, and camping as well as houseboat, ski, patio, and fishing boat rentals.",Place,BodyOfWater,Lake,New_Bullards_Bar_Reservoir,391

The bridge is a pin-connected cantilever truss, 1,600 feet (490 m) long, with one 200-foot (61 m) Pratt truss between two 160-foot (49 m) cantilever arms, with 240-foot (73 m) side arms and a 60 feet (18 m) girder span.

As originally built, the bridge carried a 20.5-foot (6.2 m) wide timber roadway, with additional ability to carry a street railway. However, the east approach to the bridge was built at a 6% grade, limiting its potential. The bridge was replaced in 1950 by the Senator George Sellar Bridge. The next year the Wenatchee Reclamation District bought the bridge for $1.00, moving the pipes from outside the truss to within. The bridge was opened to foot traffic.

The diocese includes a geographic area of 24 counties in the north central part of Texas. As of 2012, it included 20 churches and a number of other congregations in the process of reorganization. The diocese is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. Property claims related to the cathedral are currently in legal dispute. The diocese came into being in 1983 with the administrative division of the increasingly large Episcopal Diocese of Dallas. Along with its parent Diocese of Dallas, the Diocese of Fort Worth was one of the originators of a strong conservative movement within the Episcopal Church. Fort Worth and Dallas clergy and parishes have both had a long history of leadership in the Anglo-Catholic faction within American Anglicanism. After the consecration of an openly gay New Hampshire bishop, Gene Robinson, most of the parishes in the diocese affiliated with the Anglican Communion Network, an association of dioceses, parishes, and clergy opposing what its members considered a liberal shift in doctrine and practice that abandoned what they considered to be traditional teaching and discipline. There were also, however, some parishes and individuals who took a moderate or progressive position. Following the election of Katharine Jefferts Schori as the 26th Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church on June 18, 2006, Bishop Jack Iker petitioned Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to place the diocese under the jurisdiction of another primate. This appeal was joined by several other conservative dioceses but Archbishop Williams did not indicate any willingness to grant the request. At the 26th annual convention of the diocese, on November 15, 2008, delegates voted by over 80% to have the diocese become part of the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone instead of being part of the Episcopal Church. Bishop Jefferts Schori declared on November 21, 2008, that Bishop Jack Iker was inhibited from exercising his office as a bishop in the Episcopal Church because by supporting the resolution to leave the Episcopal Church he had violated Title IV, Canon 9, and abandoned \""the Doctrine, Discipline or Worship of the Church\"". In turn, Iker rejected the authority of the Presiding Bishop. Thus, the Presiding Bishop, on December 5, with the advice and consent of the church's advisory council (bishops who are the presidents or vice-presidents of each province), accepted Iker's deemed renunciation and declared the Fort Worth diocese without a bishop. The Standing Committee of the diocese, which in the absence of a bishop would then be the highest ecclesiastical authority of the diocese, regarded the inhibition of Iker as an \""illegal, unconstitutional, and uncanonical attempt to interfere with the rights and ministry of a diocese of another province of the Anglican Communion\"", thus affirming their unanimous decision to leave the Episcopal Church and realign with the Southern Cone. The Presiding Bishop then declared the diocesan leadership vacant and called a Special Convention in response to the wishes of the roughly 8,000 members of the diocese in 17 parishes who wished to remain in the Episcopal Church and had therefore been \""heartened\"" by the inhibition of Bishop Iker. The Special Convention was held in Fort Worth, at Trinity Episcopal Church, on February 7, 2009. The Right Reverend Edwin \""Ted\"" Gulick, Jr., Bishop of Kentucky, was chosen as provisional bishop and other vacant diocesan offices were filled. Although one of the last dioceses in the Episcopal Church to refuse to ordain women, the first woman was ordained in November 2009 and a new provisional bishop, C.

The number of this highway is derived from the old U.S. Route 99, with which the highway originally connected. The highway currently connects with Interstate 5 at the international border. This highway received the \""99\"" designation in 1942 after completion of the King George VI Highway (1940) to the U.S. border, and it originally shared an alignment with Highway 1 from Surrey to Vancouver via the Pattullo Bridge and Kingsway. The current freeway alignment of Highway 99 between 8th Avenue in South Surrey and the North Arm of the Fraser River opened in 1962 as Hwy. 99 and was called the Deas (Island) Throughway. Between 1964 and 1973, the freeway alignment of Highway 99 was designated Highway 499. The Oak Street Bridge was built in 1957 to cross the North Arm Fraser River, and the Deas Island Tunnel was built 1957–59 (renamed the George Massey Tunnel in 1967) to cross the Fraser River. Tolls were collected at the crossings but were rescinded by the provincial government around 1963–64. In 1957, the northern end of Highway 99 was moved from downtown Vancouver, across the Lions Gate Bridge and west to the village of Horseshoe Bay, following Marine Drive through West Vancouver. Highway 99 was re-aligned via Taylor Way, just east of the Park Royal Shopping Centre, to the Upper Levels Highway and extended to Britannia Beach one year later, extending to Squamish in 1959, and to Pemberton in 1966. Finally, in 1992, the just-paved Duffey Lake Road between Pemberton and Lillooet was made part of Highway 99, and the section of Highway 12 between Lillooet and Highway 97 was re-numbered 99. The portion of the highway between Lillooet and Pavilion was part of the route of the Old Cariboo Road. The total length of Highway 99 from the U.S. border to the Highway 97 junction is 409 kilometres (254 mi).

It rises in the Pennines and flows for 70 miles (110 km) eastwards, through the Don Valley, via Penistone, Sheffield, Rotherham, Mexborough, Conisbrough, Doncaster and Stainforth. It originally joined the Trent, but was re-engineered by Cornelius Vermuyden as the Dutch River in the 1620s, and now joins the River Ouse at Goole in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Don Valley is the local UK parliamentary constituency near the Doncaster stretch of the river. The Don can be divided into sections by the different types of structures built to restrict its passage. The upper reaches, and those of several of its tributaries, are defined by dams built to provide a public water supply. The middle section contains many weirs, which were built to supply mills, foundries and cutlers' wheels with water power, while the lower section contains weirs and locks, designed to maintain water levels for navigation.The Don's major tributaries are the Loxley, the Rivelin, the Sheaf, the Rother and the Dearne. Along the Sheffield–Rotherham stretch of the river are five weirs that punctuate a local walking and cycling route, the Five Weirs Walk. A further walk, the Upper Don Walk, is being developed that will make it possible to walk or cycle from Sheffield city centre up to Oughtibridge.

109422,"The Wutach Valley Railway or German: Wutachtalbahn is one of the most unusual and impressive stretches of railway in Germany. It links the town of Waldshut-Tiengen, on the Upper Rhine Railway (Hochrheinbahn) and the border of Baden-Württemberg and Switzerland, with Immendingen on the Black Forest Railway (Schwarzwaldbahn). Because of the twisting route of its central section, it is popularly known as the Sauschwänzlebahn (pigtail line). The line was planned in the 1860s, though construction was not completed until the 1890s, and its purpose was at least partly strategic, to allow a means for moving military supplies around the south of the Black Forest; the German Empire having seized Alsace and Lorraine from the French in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, a revenge attack in this area from the French or a preemptive strike to prevent one were key issues in German military thinking at the time. The normal commercial route along the Rhine passed into Swiss territory so could not be used for military purposes. The southern section of the line, following the valley of the Wutach river from Waldshut-Tiengen to Weizen (part of the town of Stühlingen), is relatively conventional. However, the middle section, from Weizen to Blumberg, involved an approximately 250 meter gain in height, and the military authorities specified that the line must not have a gradient of more than 1:100 since there was a need to move heavy military equipment. Accordingly, the line proceeds in a series of curves (including one complete circle), taking 26.5 km of track to travel a beeline distance of 9.5 km, with spectacular large viaducts, tunnels and bridges including the only spiral railway tunnel in Germany. The track is of standard gauge and is mainly single track; the bridges and tunnels were built on a scale to allow eventual doubling of the track, though this was never carried out. The final section, from Blumberg to meet the Black Forest Railway near Geisingen, is again relatively conventional. The unconventional configuration of the track resulted in increased fares, as ticket prices were calculated on the distance travelled along the track. The line did indeed play a strategic role at various times in its history, and its most recent refurbishment (in the early 1960s) was carried out with NATO funds. However, in the period after the Second World War its commercial use declined, and, section by section, passenger service was withdrawn, though the southern section remained open for freight traffic until 2001. After the Deutsche Bundesbahn withdrew passenger services on the central section in 1974, a voluntary organization was set up in 1976 to re-open it as a museum line under steam traction, and it is now a popular tourist attraction. There have been a number of initiatives to re-open passenger services on the other sections of the line as part of a regional transport strategy, and since December 2004 the northern section has formed part of the 3rd Ring Railway (3er Ringzug) network of local railway lines in the south-eastern part of the Black Forest, in the districts of Tuttlingen, Rottweil and Schwarzwald-Baar.

The level of the lake varies by approximately 4 to 5 meters along with the varying underground water flow during the year, hence reaches its minimum by the end of April when snow melting in the mountains increases.

The very western bay never freezes in winter, probably showing a maximum water flow in this area. When the lake is at a low level, with a small volume of water, it warms up sooner than most lakes in the region, so people can be seen starting to swim the lake in April while bigger lakes even in lower areas of Switzerland remain rather cool. Water temperature in summer is at an average 21 Celsius, with a maximum around 24 Celsius.

Eejanaika is the taller, faster, and longer of the two. The roller coaster, designed by S&S Arrow, is a \""4th Dimension\"" coaster, a design in which the seats can rotate forward or backward 360 degrees in a controlled spin. This is achieved by having four rails on the track: two of these are running rails while the other two are for spin control. The two rails that control the spin of the seats move up and down relative to the track and spin the seats using a rack and pinion gear mechanism. Eejanaika has the second \""え\"" turned upside down for the roller coaster's official spelling. Eejanaika has several meanings, but means \""Ain't it great!\"" According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Eejanaika is the roller coaster with the most inversions in the world.

The track itself only inverts three times - \n* Inside raven turn (½) \n* full-full/zero-g roll (1) \n* fly to lie (½) \n* outside raven turn (½) \n* half camelback twist (½) This has led to some controversy in the roller coaster enthusiast community concerning the legitimacy of Eejanaika's claim.

It was discovered on 6 September 1986, by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–3.0 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,384 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 32 years prior to its discovery observation. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory in December 2009. It gave a well-defined rotation period of 2.75796±0.00003 hours with a brightness variation of 0.12 in magnitude (U=3). In January 2014, astronomer Julian Oey at the Australian Blue Mountains Observatory (Q68) obtained a nearly identical period of 2.7576±0.0001 hours with an amplitude of 0.15 magnitude (U=3-). According to the surveys carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 4.5 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a high albedo of 0.42 and 0.43, respectively, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 5.7 kilometers.

139529,"The River Drone is a river which flows south from its source on the Sheffield, South Yorkshire border. It flows through Dronfield, Unstone and Unstone Green in Derbyshire before merging at Sheepbridge to the north of Chesterfield with the Barlow Brook. It then flows south east till it merges with the River Rother at Brimmington Road North (B6050) at Chesterfield. It is one of the three main tributaries of the Rother. In the late 1990s the river burst its banks and flooded Dronfield 'bottom' shopping area, and as a result a flood storage reservoir was built at Bowshaw to hold back (attenuate) the storm water runoff from the Batemoor and Jordanthorpe housing estates in the south of Sheffield, which form part of the catchment area. Some work was also done to build up the bank level with bunds or retaining walls in some sections of the valley. The river used to feed several water wheels at early factories in the Dronfield valley in the 18th and 19th centuries. Part of the mill race is visible off Mill Lane in Dronfield, the remains of the mill being demolished in the 1970s. This river was highly polluted at times in the past and devoid of any fish life along its full length from Sheffield to its confluence with the Barlow Brook due to mine workings discharging into the river. Also, as with other local rivers, it suffered from sewage discharges from storm overflows. It has been cleaned up in recent years, as the water boards have to meet tighter environmental regulations with brown trout making an appearance below Unstone. The flow of the river has been measured using a weir, just below the confluence with the Barlow Brook at Sheepbridge since 1976.

Part of the Argentine Andes, it is considered the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity. Incapillo is one of several ignimbritic or calderic systems that, along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone. Subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America plate is responsible for most of the volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone. After activity in the western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago, volcanism started up in the Incapillo region, forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero. Later, a number of lava domes formed between these volcanoes. Incapillo is the source of the Incapillo ignimbrite, a medium-sized deposit comparable to the Katmai ignimbrite. With a volume of about 20.4 cubic kilometres (4.9 cu mi), the Incapillo ignimbrite was erupted 0.52 ± 0.03 and 0.51 ± 0.04 million years ago. A caldera with dimensions of 5 by 6 kilometres (3.1 mi × 3.7 mi) was formed during the eruption.

It is located about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Lassen Peak and provides an excellent view of Brokeoff Mountain, Lassen Peak, and Chaos Crags. The cone was built to a height of 750 feet (230 m) above the surrounding area and spread ash over 30 square miles (78 km2). Then, like many cinder cones, it was snuffed out when several basalt lava flows erupted from its base. These flows, called the Fantastic Lava Beds, spread northeast and southwest, and dammed creeks, first creating Snag Lake on the south and then Butte Lake to the north. Butte Lake is fed by water from Snag Lake seeping through the lava beds. Nobles Emigrant Trail goes around Snag Lake and follows the edge of the lava beds. Its age has been controversial since the 1870s, when many people thought it was only a few decades old. Later, the cone and associated lava flows were thought to have formed about 1700 or during a 300-year- long series of eruptions ending in 1851.

159985,"Sieciechów [ɕeˈt͡ɕexuf] is a village in Kozienice County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Sieciechów. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, near a rail line from Radom to Dęblin, on the National Road 48, approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) south-east of Kozienice and 92 km (57 mi) south-east of Warsaw. Sieciechów used to be a town from 1232 to 1869. Sieciechów has a long and rich history. Until the 14th century, it was one of major political, economical and administrative centers of Lesser Poland’s Duchy of Sandomierz, which later was renamed into Sandomierz Voivodeship. It was the seat of a castellan and a county, but in the late 14th century, Sieciechów's importance diminished, and it was replaced as administrative center of this part of Lesser Poland by quickly-developing Radom. Sieciechów takes its name from Sieciech - a palatine at the court of duke Władysław I Herman. In the times of the Piast dynasty, Sieciechów was the seat of local dukes, and first mention of the village dates back to the 10th century. In 1132 the Sieciechów Castle became the property of High Prince Bolesław Krzywousty and became the seat of castellans. As Gall Anonim wrote, it was the biggest castle along the Vistula between Sandomierz and Płock. In 1232 Sieciechów received a town charter (Magdeburg rights). In the late Middle Ages, Sieciechów was located on a merchant trail from Sandomierz through Zawichost, to Lithuanian lands. It had a parish church of St. Lawrence, which controlled parishes of large parts of northern Lesser Poland, at such towns, as Kozienice, Stężyca, Dęblin, Zwoleń and Kazimierz Dolny. Sieciechów probably had a defensive wall, and a Vistula river port. Its first known castellan was named Florian, his name was mentioned in 1239. In 1432 King Władysław Jagiełło gave permission for fairs, but period of prosperity ended after the change of the course of the Vistula. As a result, the town no longer controlled the strategic river, and the castle, which was located on a hill right above river bank, no longer fulfilled its role. Furthermore, after the Union of Krewo, Poland was no longer threatened by Lithuanian raids. Sieciechów remained a town until 1869, when the government of Russian-controlled Congress Poland reduced it to the status of a village. Among points of interest there are: \n*  Baroque abbey church (1739-1767),  \n*  complex of a Benedictine Abbey. The abbey itself was founded by either Sieciech or Boleslaw Krzywousty. Its original location is not known, the abbey was moved to its present location some time in the mid-14th century. Current complex was built in the 18th century. The abbey had a renowned school, which existed until 1575, and a large library, \n*  St. Lawrence parish church (1710-1769), with a bell from 1459, \n*  Sieciechów Castle. It is not known when original, wooden castle was built, but it has been established that the stone complex was built by King Kazimierz Wielki. The castle was already in ruins by 1575, after it had long lost its strategic importance.",Place,Settlement,Village,"Sieciechów,_Masovian_Voivodeship",510

It takes 4 days to reach the its top, one way (7 days for the complete expedition). Journeys require about 6 to 10 hours hiking per day. The climb to the summit is nontechnical, but since the trail often gets consumed by its own wildlife, it is absolutely necessary to have a certified guide.

The absolute fragility and unspoiled nature of this area requires that explorers take very important precautions: take only new tenting and camping equipment, free of spores, mildew or other microorganisms, as they may cause an ecological disaster.

The satellite provides three broadcast beams, of horizontal and vertical polarisation that cover three areas of the Earth’s surface. The Pan-European Wide beam provides DTH reception on 60 cm dishes across Europe from Spain to the Black Sea and from Greece to Scandinavia. The European spot beam (for central and eastern Europe) and the Middle East spot beam (the Arabian Peninsula, Iran and Iraq) provide for contribution and distribution services, and data and IP trunking services between the two regions with Ka band uplink and downlink used in Europe and Ku band in the Middle East. Astra 3B was finally launched in May 2010 after nearly two months delay caused by technical problems to the main stage pressurization system of the Ariane 5 rocket, including two on-the-launch-pad postponements on March 24, 2010 and April 9.

In 1973, their debut album \""See See The Sun\"" was released, including three hit singles. Their main popularity was in the Netherlands, with their top hit (Ruthless Queen) reaching No. 6 on the Dutch charts in March 1979. They disbanded in 1982 after releasing nine albums. In 1999 the band was asked to perform on the TV show De Vrienden van Amstel Live. After this performance, they decided to reform, and released seven further studio albums and three live albums. On 4 January 2008 they released Coming Up For Air. That same day saw the start of their 35th anniversary-tour. On 7 October 2008, they ended the tour at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was released on CD and DVD as The Anniversary Box in December 2008. In October 2009 the band embarked on a Dutch tour. According to Ton Scherpenzeel (on the band's website), after that tour Kayak would no longer do the album-tour-album-tour cycle. They would probably keep on making new music though, as Scherpenzeel stated. But the sudden and unexpected death of Pim Koopman in November 2009 (halfway through the tour) made the future of the band very uncertain. In May 2010, the band's website announced a tribute concert for Pim Koopman. The concert was held on 22 November at the Paradiso. It involved not only Kayak, but also some artists with whom Koopman had worked in the past. Some of the names that appeared on stage: Pussycat, Caren Maywood, Alides Hidding, José Hoebee and Michael Robinson. Okkie Huysdens (with whom Koopman formed The President) and Jeroen Engelbert (one of many members of Koopman's band Diesel) also performed. For the occasion, Kayak used Hans Voerman as an extra keyboard player. The drumstool was occupied by Hans Eijkenaar. After the concert, Kayak announced that Eijkenaar was the new drummer of Kayak. With Eijkenaar on drums, Kayak released their album Anywhere But Here in September 2011. On 21 September 2012, it was exactly 40 years ago that the band's name was chosen. To celebrate this, Kayak went on a tour titled Journey through Time, after one of their songs. They played at least one song from each studio album. Also included was an excerpt from their forthcoming album Cleopatra - The Crown Of Isis. That excerpt was also released on an EP, backed by a newly recorded version of Symmetry, a song that Scherpenzeel and Koopman originally wrote in 1971. The album Cleopatra - The Crown Of Isis was released in November 2014. At the end of 2014, Cindy Oudshoorn and Edward Reekers announced their departure from Kayak, leaving the band without lead vocalists.

The station callsign and branding was later changed to 2ZG. In 1978 2ZG moved to 945AM, the change in frequency was due to the New Zealand AM band changing from 10 kHz frequency spacing to 9 kHz spacing. Coinciding with the change the station became known on air as The Coaster 2ZG. The Coaster 2ZG began broadcasting on 90.9FM during the 1990s and was rebranded as ZGFM.

Known for innovations in his office, Fuselier was the sheriff from 1980 until c. 2003, when he resigned prior to the nonpartisan blanket primary for what would have been his seventh term. Fuselier's father, Charles J. Fuselier, was the sheriff prior to 1978, when he died in office. Fuselier was elected sheriff in 1979 and took office in the summer of 1980, after the two-year interim period of Sheriff Allan B. Durand (1919–2006). Durand had been chief deputy under the first Sheriff Fuselier and continued thereafter as first deputy under Charles A. Fuselier until Durand's retirement. He was reelected in 1983 with more than 86 percent of the ballots cast. In his last contested re-election in 1995, Fuselier polled more than 65 percent of the vote over three opponents. He was succeeded by Ronald J. \""Ronny\"" Theriot (born 1946), an Independent and former major with the Louisiana State Police, who assumed the office on October 16, 2003. In 1983, Fuselier oversaw the completion of a new jail; in 1990, the installation of a parish-wide 911 system; in 1991, the creation of a sheriff's substation, and in 1995, the construction of a facility for juveniles. In 1996, he received the National Sheriff of the Year award, an honor for which he expressed \""shock\"". Then U.S. Representative Jimmy Hayes of Louisiana's 7th congressional district, since disbanded, honored Fuselier in a speech delivered on the floor of Congress. In his address, Hayes noted that Fuselier initiated a local partnership between the sheriff's office, the St. Martinville chief of police, and the American Association of Retired Persons to create the first TRIAD program in St. Martin Parish, which works to prevent crimes against senior citizens. In 1999, the St. Martin Parish sheriff's office under Fuselier became the first in Louisiana to receive the imprint of the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. Though Fuselier's political career occurred while he was a Democrat, the office of Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler lists Fuselier and his wife, the former Lyndahl Hobgood (born June 1943), as Republican voters, as of December 2013. As a student from 1953 to 1959 at St. Martinville Senior High School, an entity of the St. Martin Parish School Board, Fuselier was active in 4-H. Thereafter, as sheriff he was heavily involved in the promotion of 4-H programs. In 1981, he established the Charles Fuselier Livestock Award, named for his father, and the subsequent Charles Fuselier Scholarship in 2002. In 2008, he was inducted into the 4-H Hall of Fame, housed in a museum in Avoyelles Parish south of Alexandria. In 2003, Fuselier was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

Led by Felix Chung and chaired by Tommy Cheung, the Liberal Party is currently the sixth largest party in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, holding four seats. Derived from the Co-operative Resources Centre in 1993, the Liberal Party was founded by a group of conservative politicians, businessmen and professionals who were appointed by the colonial governor or elected through trade-based functional constituencies to counter the rise of the pro-democracy camp elected through the the first ever direct election in 1991 to the legislature. The Liberal Party aligned to the Beijing government in the last years of the colonial rule and remained one of the largest parties with the pro-democracy Democratic Party and the Beijing-loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) in the first decade of the SAR period through the business sectors of the functional constituencies with restricted electorates. The Liberal Party's popularity rose to the peak after its chairman James Tien resigned from the Executive Council to halt down the government proposal of the Basic Law Article 23 legislation in the wake of the large-scale demonstration in 2003.

Bradshaw has been described as \""a future All-Star\"" and \""one of the best attacking defenders in the country\"". Bradshaw was part of a very successful St Mary's College, Galway team along with current Galway players Paul Conroy, Eoin Concannon, Eddie Hoare and David O'Connell. Bradshaw made his debut in the 2008 Championship, against Roscommon in the Connacht SFC 1st Round clash. He was one of four debutants introduced by manager Liam Sammon. He kept his place for the semi-final against Leitrim. In the build-up to the 2008 Connacht Final against Mayo, his starting place was under threat since Keiran Fitzgerald, All-Ireland medal winner and former captain had regained full fitness but Sammon decided to keep faith with Bradshaw. He returned the faith placed in him by putting in an impressive performance against Mayo, scoring one point in Galway's 2-12 to 1-14 victory. Bradshaw plays his club football with Moycullen. Moycullen were crowned the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football champions although Bradshaw missed the final due to suspension after being sent off in the simi-final with Annascaul. He has since established himself as one of the main fixtures in the Galway panel, with his aggressive forward runs and his ability to read the game. He has played in numerous positions, including corner back, wing back and midfield but his strongest position is often centre half back as he has the ability to control the game from that area of the field. He has been linked with a move to the AFL with clubs such as St. Kilda having offered him a contract.

She is notable together with Chandra Khonnokyoong for linking the lineage of the Dhammakaya Movement from Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro down to the third generation and for having helped develop the ceremony for ‘offering sustenance to the Lord Buddha’ (Bucha Khao Phra), together with Chandra Khonnokyoong. This ceremony has subsequently become an identifying feature of the Dhammakaya Movement. Thongsuk Samdaengpan was born on 1 August 1900 at Baan Saphan Lueang, Bangrak District, Bangkok. She was the third born to her father Rom and mother Wan. She was separated from her parents at an early age, being adopted by her uncle and aunt instead. She had no formal education and was illiterate. She married Dr. Chin Samdaengpan, a surgeon at Chulalongkorn Hospital. They had two children together before the untimely death of her husband - from which time onwards, Thongsuk Samdaengpan had to support herself and her children working as a salesperson. In 1930, Thongsuk Samdaengpan started to study meditation at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen under the instruction of Luang Pu Sodh using the Dhammakaya Meditation method, being able to attain the Dhammakaya by 1935. She was accepted as an advanced pracitioner in Luang Pu Sodh's \""meditation factory\"" (Thai: \""โรงงานทำวิชชา\""), while being authorized to teach meditation outside the temple in Bangkok households, such as that of Liap Sikanchananand. In 1936 she accepted Chandra Khonnokyoong as her student. In 1938, she went on a one-month meditation retreat at Wat Paknam, at the end of which she renounced the worldly life together with Chandra Khonnokyoong and both ordained as maechi at Wat Paknam. Thongsuk Samdaengpan became an exceptionally gifted Dhamma teacher, answering questions in a way that was easy to understand and helping meditators overcome hindrances. She travelled around Thailand to spread the Dhamma and teach Dhammakaya Meditation according to the policy of Luang Pu Sodh – sometimes accompanied by Mae Ji Thean Theerawat, sometimes by Chandra Khonnokyoong. She had occasion to teach in eighteen provinces which included Nakhon Pathom, Ratchaburi, Sing Buri, Chachoengsao, Chonburi, Prachinburi, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok  and was therefore notable as one of the leading teachers of Buddhism in Thailand at that time.

He left behind a budding career as Junimea's polemicist and cultural journalist, joining the state bureaucracy of the United Principalities, the Romanian diplomatic corps, and ultimately electoral politics. A speaker for aristocratic sentiment and the Romanian gentry, Carp helped create the Conservative Party from the various \""White\"" conservative clubs (1880), but also led a Junimist dissident wing against the Conservative mainstream leaders Lascăr Catargiu and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. He was a contributor to the Junimea platform Convorbiri Literare, and founder of the newspapers Térra (1868) and Moldova (1915). Widely seen as unyielding and trenchant in his public stance, and respected as an orator, P. P. Carp stood against the majority current in various political debates. His entire discourse was an alternative to the protectionist, antisemitic and populist tendencies of \""Red\"" Romanian liberalism. Welcoming Westernization and free trade, his vision of development nonetheless rested on gradualism and criticized modern experiments in governance. The two Carp administrations are remembered for their fiscal reforms, their encouragement of foreign investments, and their attempted clampdown on political corruption. A Germanophile and a Russophobe, Carp gathered consensus for steering the Kingdom of Romania into the Triple Alliance, but his external policy became entirely unpopular by the start of World War I. During that time, he was the only prominent public figure to demand a declaration of war against the Entente Powers. He came out of retirement during the German occupation of Romania, when he inspired fellow Conservative Lupu Kostaki to set up a collaborationist territorial government. This final project caused his fall into disgrace once the legitimate government regained control.",Agent,Politician,PrimeMinister,Petre_P._Carp,348

During his long reign Gunchen Chanyu outlived the Han emperors Wendi Liu Heng 文帝劉恆 (r. 180–157 BC, Hyao Wyn Huan-di in Bichurin), Jingdi Liu Qi 景帝 劉啟 (r. 157–141 BC, Hyao-Jing-di in Bichurin), and died during the reign of the Han emperor Wudi Liu Che 武帝 劉徹 (r. 141–87 BC). All three Chinese emperors confirmed the heqin 和親 peace and kinship treaty with the Huns, pledging to live by its terms. The treaty generally held during the reign of Gunchen Chanyu, however, the Chinese annals note that the mutual relations were imperiled on a number of occasions, which included appeals of the Chinese contenders for the Xiong Gnu's assistance and protection, the Xiong Gnu's retaliatory raids as punishments for violation of the treaty terms, and one direct Chinese assault against the Chanyu. The Huns were especially sensitive about unimperiled trade relations, which were one of the terms of the heqin treaty, and the Chinese annals specifically note a number of instances of the border trade opening, implying that the border trade was at times banned. The ambush happened in the 133 BCE, when Gunchen Chanyu was lured inside the border, and he almost run into an ambush of a 300,000 strong Chinese army. Only a disclosure by a Chinese officer about the planned ambush saved the Chanyu. After the failed ambush, the treaty was practically abrogated, the relations soured, the border traders were assaulted, in 127 BC the Chinese army attacked and expelled the Hun's tribes Leu-fan (楼烦, 樓煩, Leufang, Liufan, Loufan, Loufang) and Bayan (白羊王) from the Ordos, and then built fortifications and forts to retain the captured territory.

310998,"The Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) Party is an Australian political party which advocates the legalisation of cannabis. The group was founded in 1993 by Nigel Quinlan, who ran as a candidate under the name Nigel Freemarijuana. In 2001, Freemarijuana's name was assessed by the Australian Electoral Commission as to whether it was suitable to be added to the electoral roll – the Commission found that it was, meaning Freemarijuana could run as an electoral candidate under the name. HEMP is based in Nimbin, New South Wales, the centre of Australia's cannabis culture. HEMP has unsuccessfully stood candidates in several federal and state elections, but has struggled to maintain the membership and regulatory requirements for party registration in Australia. In 2007, prior to the 2007 federal election, HEMP was de-registered as a political party by the Australian Electoral Commission after a random audit of its membership. The group re-applied for party registration in February 2010, but according to HEMP secretary Graham Askey, delays in processing their application meant that registration did not proceed in time before the 2010 federal election was called. It was formally registered on 23 September 2010. The party received a nationwide Senate vote of 0.71 percent at the 2013 federal election. Historically the party's best result was at the 1994 Elizabeth by-election in South Australia with a 5.37 percent primary vote.

Listed at 5' 10\"", 175 lbs., he batted and threw right-handed. Christopher reached the majors in 1959 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, spending three years with them before moving to the New York Mets (1962–65) and Boston Red Sox (1966). While in Pittsburgh, Christopher was used as a backup in all three outfield positions for Bob Skinner (LF), Bill Virdon (CF) and Roberto Clemente (RF). He was first called up when Clemente was injured, making his debut in nothing less than Harvey Haddix’s pitching masterpiece of 12 perfect innings on May 26, 1959. As a member of the 1960 World Series Champion Pirates, he was a utility player, pinch-running in three games and scoring two runs (games 2 and 5). Christopher became the Mets’ fifth pick in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft. In 1964 he enjoyed easily his finest season as a major-leaguer, hitting .300 with 16 home runs, 76 RBI, 78 runs, 163 hits, 26 doubles, and eight triples in 154 games, all career-highs. He had a career-best day on August 19, collecting two triples, a double, and a home run in an 8–6 victory over his former Pirates teammates. Then, on September 25 he broke up the no-hit bid of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Jim Maloney at Shea Stadium. His second-inning single was the only hit against Maloney, who had to settle for a 3–0 shutout. Christopher played briefly in 1966 for the Red Sox and was dealt with pitcher Earl Wilson to the Detroit Tigers, who sent Julio Navarro as part of the package. Although Christopher’s major league career had come to an end on June 9, 1966 (he never played for Detroit), he stayed active in the minors through 1968. He also played winter baseball in Dominican Republic, Mexico and Puerto Rico. In an eight-season career, Christopher was a .260 hitter with 29 home runs and 173 RBI in 638 games, including one five-hit game and eight four-hit games.",Agent,Athlete,BaseballPlayer,Joe_Christopher,347
313447,"Eggstone is a Swedish Indie Pop band, formed in 1986. The three members - Per Sunding (vocals, bass), Patrik Bartosch (guitar) and Maurits Carlsson (drums) - were raised in the small coastal town of Lomma, outside Malmö. In 1991 they formed Tambourine Studios in Malmö with friends Anders Nordgren and producer Tore Johansson. Their debut album Eggstone In San Diego was released in 1992, followed by Somersault two years later. In early 1997, they released Vive La Différence!, their third full-length album, on their own (and now defunct) Vibrafon label. Spanish Slalom, a compilation album, was released on Madrid-based Siesta Records in 1998 and a second compilation appeared in 1999 under the Tricatel label, titled Ca Chauffe en Suède!. Eggstone's songs, light and poppy on the surface, disguise great subtlety in their conception and execution. The trio delights in strange shifts of tempo, harmonic clashes and pseudo-amateurish incidental noises, whilst retaining an easy seductiveness for untrained ears. All three members are accomplished musicians; Bartosch in particular who has developed a guitar style entirely his own, both faux-naïf and virtuosic. A fourth album has reportedly been in preparation since the late 1990s, with some sessions taking place under the tutelage of Tricatel owner/in-house producer Bertrand Burgalat. Per Sunding's work as an in-demand producer in his home country and Patrick Bartosch's taste for foreign trips have unfortunately prevented the band from doing more than teasing fans. Eggstone's lack of large-scale commercial success is all the more surprising since the trio was the inspiration and, to some extent, the template for a number of internationally successful Swedish Indie Pop acts such as Cinnamon and The Cardigans. In April 2016 the band made a surprise comeback when the song \""Like So\"" appeared on various streaming services, their first new music in 19 years.",Agent,Group,Band,Eggstone,299

On August 31, 1828, next to José María Urvina, Francisco Robles, Luis de Tola and several others, under the command of Captain Tomás Carlos Wright, had an exceptional participation in the Battle of Punta Malpelo. During the early years of the Republic of Ecuador, Franco continued his ascent through the ranks, until in 1857, during the presidency of General Francisco Robles, he was designated Chief of the Garrison of Guayaquil. By August 1859, Franco was the General Commander of the District of Guayas, and the third in the Urbinista caudillo hierarchy, after Urvina and Robles. Like all military men of the time, he aspired to the presidency of the republic, and awaited the moment that he could take power via a coup.

He made a deal with Peruvian President Ramón Castilla, who wanted to make the most of the Ecuadorian civil unrest in order to secure a favorable outcome for his side in the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857-1860, additionally convincing Castilla to back him against García Moreno. On January 25, 1860, the Treaty of Mapasingue was signed by Franco and Castilla, with Franco accepting the Peruvian demands in exchange for money, men, weapons, ships and munitions for the coming fight against García Moreno's provisional government.

339397,"Palawan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), also known by its call sign DYPR, was the first local radio station to serve the island of Palawan, the Philippines. It was established in 1965, in the capital Puerto Princesa City, by Ramon Oliveros (Ray Oliver) Decolongon. The station faced many difficulties in its early years. Although Palawan could receive some broadcasts from Manila and neighbouring Visayan islands, radio ownership among the 20,000-strong population was not high. The Tinio Electric Plant provided electricity only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and to less than half the population. Then, in 1966, Decolongon was killed in a plane crash: his father, Emilio Decolongon, took over as company president. In September 1972 martial law was declared throughout the Philippines and all broadcasting stations were shut down, but DYPR was able to reopen fairly quickly after making its case as a provider of essential services. The station had become a part of the communications of the island, broadcasting urgent personal messages—known as Panawagans—as a free service to the community. As of 2006, radio broadcast languages include Tagalog and Ilocano, and DYPR is affiliated to Radio Mindanao Network, Inc. (RMN). In 1986, PBC began television broadcasts.

His exact place of birth is unknown but has been identified as Ypsicron (present-day Cirò). Nicodemus’ parents were named Theophanus and Pandia, and they entrusted their son's spiritual education to a priest named Galato (Galatone). Early on, Nicodemus was attracted to the monastic life, and wished to join the ascetics who had established themselves in the zone known as the Mercurion, on the cliffs of the Pollino in Calabria. He was at first refused entry into the community by the austere abbot Saint Fantinus (Fantino), who did not think Nicodemus could endure the penances and mortifications, but eventually the abbot relented. The reputation for holiness and austerity of these Calabrian monks, whose number included Saint Nilus of Rossano (San Nilo di Rossano), was such that they received praised by Orestes, patriarch of Jerusalem. Eventually, Nicodemus withdrew to Mount Cellerano (or Kellerano, today San Nicodemo) in the area known as Locride, where his fame attracted a new community of monks there. This community was threatened by Muslim raids, and so Nicodemus relocated to Gerace and thence to Mammola, where a monastery was later established.

172883,"(For other people named Ray Kennedy, see Ray Kennedy (disambiguation).) Raymond Kennedy (born 28 July 1951) is an English former footballer who won every domestic honour in the game with Arsenal and Liverpool in the 1970s and early 1980s. Kennedy played as a forward for Arsenal, and then played as a left-sided midfielder for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the Football League, and also won 17 caps for England between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals. Born and raised in former pit village Seaton Delaval, he spent a year at Port Vale as a schoolboy, before returning to Northumberland to work in a sweet factory after he was released at the age of 16. He was then spotted playing for New Hartley Juniors by Arsenal, and went on to turn professional at the club in November 1968. He made his first team debut ten months later, and went on to win the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, the First Division and FA Cup Double in 1970–71, and then play on the losing side in the 1972 FA Cup Final. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record £200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that Bill Shankly resigned as manager. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager Bob Paisley converted him to a left-sided midfielder he went on to help Liverpool to become the dominant club of English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, and 1981–82), the FA Charity Shield four times (1976, 1977, 1979, and 1980), the European Cup three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the UEFA Cup (1976), UEFA Super Cup (1977), and League Cup (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1981), and World Club Championship (1981), and won the Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award in 1977–78. He joined Swansea City for a £160,000 fee in January 1982, and added a Welsh Cup winners medal to his collection four months later. However the effects of Parkinson's disease began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he dropped into the Fourth Division with Hartlepool United in November 1983. During the 1984–85 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of Cyprus club Pezoporikos and later played for Northern League club Ashington. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was tough, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993. He was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder during his time at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the England under-23 side he was unable to translate his club form into a good international career, and was used as a stand-in for Trevor Brooking before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981.

256772,"William Henry McEnaney (February 14, 1952 in Springfield, Ohio) is a former professional baseball player. He was a left-handed pitcher over parts of six seasons in Major League Baseball (1974–79) with the Cincinnati Reds, Montreal Expos, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals. McEnaney was one of five children of William and Eleanor (Grieb) McEnaney and attended Springfield North High School in Springfield, Ohio. He was drafted by the Reds in the eighth round of the 1970 amateur draft. He made his Major League debut at age 22 on July 3, 1974 in relief of starter Clay Carroll in a 4–1 Reds loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium. McEnaney's first-ever inning was a 1–2–3 one as he induced popouts from Tommy John, Davey Lopes and Bill Buckner, and for the game he pitched two scoreless innings. In his rookie season, he pitched 24 games, with a 2–1 record and a 4.44 earned run average. McEnaney was a key member of the bullpen of the 1975 and 1976 World Series champions Big Red Machine. In 1975, he posted a 5–2 record with a 2.47 ERA and 15 saves in 70 pitching appearances, but he is best known for his performance in the Series, in which he pitched five games (6.2 innings) in relief with a 2.70 ERA and one save, moreover for his exploits in the deciding Game 7. Entering in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the Reds clinging to a 4–3 lead over the Boston Red Sox, McEnaney got Juan Beníquez to fly out followed by a Bob Montgomery groundout. He then sealed the World Series title and became part of an iconic Reds moment as he induced Carl Yastrzemski to hit a flyball to centerfield, which was grabbed by César Gerónimo, followed by McEnaney's teammates swarming him and celebrating around the pitcher's mound. In 1976 he fell to 2–6 with a 4.85 ERA in 55 games. But he again excelled in the World Series, pitching 4.2 scoreless innings in two games and earning two saves. And, just as in the previous World Series, he closed out the series with a 1–2–3 ninth inning, only this time it was for a four-game sweep over the New York Yankees. In December 1976 he was traded to the Expos, for whom in 1977 he pitched 69 games with a 3–5 record and a 3.95 ERA. He was then traded to the Pirates shortly before the 1978 season and pitched only six games with a 10.38 ERA. Released by the Pirates, he played for the Cardinals in 1979. In that season he pitched in 25 games with an 0–3 record and a fine 2.95 ERA, but it was his final season in the majors as the Cardinals released him just prior to the 1980 season. For his Major League career he compiled 12–17 record with a 3.76 earned run average and 148 strikeouts in 269 appearances, all as a relief pitcher. Besides, McEnaney played in Mexico with the Águilas de Mexicali and the Plataneros de Tabasco, as well as for the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association. In 1980, while pitching for Mexicali, McEnaney hurled a 1–0 no-hitter against the Algodoneros de Guasave. McEnaney lives in Florida with his second wife, Cindy, and they have two grown sons. He also has a daughter from his first marriage.

He wrote numerous treatises on mechanics, geography, mineralogy and astronomy. Born in Nishapur, in northeastern Persia, at a young age he moved to Samarkand and obtained his education there. Afterwards he moved to Bukhara and became established as one of the major mathematicians and astronomers of the Islamic Golden Age. He wrote one of the most important treatises on algebra written before modern times, the Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra (1070), which includes a geometric method for solving cubic equations by intersecting a hyperbola with a circle. He contributed to a calendar reform. His significance as a philosopher and teacher, and his few remaining philosophical works, have not received the same attention as his scientific and poetic writings. Al-Zamakhshari referred to him as \""the philosopher of the world\"". He taught the philosophy of Avicenna for decades in Nishapur. Outside Iran and Persian-speaking countries, Khayyám has influenced literature and societies through the translation of his works and popularization by other scholars. The greatest such effect was in English-speaking countries. The English scholar Thomas Hyde (1636–1703) was the first non-Persian known to have studied his works. The most influential, however, was Edward FitzGerald (1809–83), who made Khayyám famous in the West through his translation and adaptations of Khayyám's quatrains (Persian: رباعیات‎‎ rubāʿiyāt) in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Khayyám died in 1131, and is buried in the Khayyám Garden in Nishapur.

Formed by John Gorham, the unit served as the prototype for many subsequent ranger forces, including the better known Rogers' Rangers. The unit started out as a Massachusetts provincial auxiliary company, which means it was not part of the province's normal militia system. Recruited in the summer of 1744 at the start of King George's War, Governor William Shirley ordered the unit raised as reinforcements for the then-besieged British garrison at Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal. Over the next eight years the unit proved remarkably effective at suppressing Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance to British rule in Nova Scotia and helped to both expand and secure the British sphere of influence in the region. Initially a sixty-man all-Indian company led by British colonial officers, the original Native American members of the unit were gradually replaced by Anglo-Americans and recent Scots and Irish immigrants and were a minority in the unit by the mid-1750s. The company were reconnaissance experts as well as renowned for their expertise at both water-borne operations and frontier guerrilla warfare. They were known for surprise amphibious raids on Acadian and Mi'kmaq coastal or riverine settlements, using large whaleboats, which carried between ten and fifteen rangers each. This small unit was the main British military force defending Nova Scotia from 1744 to 1749. The company became part of the British army and was expanded during the Seven Years' War and went on to play an important role in fighting in Nova Scotia as well as participating in many of the important campaigns of the war, particularly distinguishing itself at the Siege of Quebec in 1759.",Agent,Organisation,MilitaryUnit,Gorham's_Rangers,284

Farnes was born in Leytonstone, Essex, and was educated at the Royal Liberty School in Gidea Park. He made his first-class debut for Essex in 1930, aged only 19. He took 5-36 in his second county match against Kent. He studied at Cambridge University, playing cricket in the University side for three years while also continuing to play for Essex. After graduating, he became a teacher at Worksop College, which limited his opportunity to play for Essex. Farnes was reduced to tears in 1932, playing against Yorkshire at Scarborough. Earlier that year, playing at Leyton, Yorkshire had beaten Essex by an innings and 313 runs. Farnes reinforced Essex for the return match. Bowling as fast as he could, he conceded 75 runs to Herbert Sutcliffe and Maurice Leyland in 4 overs, and Essex lost again by an innings and 8 runs. In 1933, he took 41 wickets for Cambridge at a bowling average of 17.39 runs; in all, he took 113 wickets at an average of 18.38 that year. He was called up for the 1st Test against Australia in 1934, at Trent Bridge, taking 5-102 and 5-77, although England lost by 238 runs. He also played in the 2nd Test at Lord's, but was then injured, missing the next 2 tests and only playing again towards the end of the season. After two further Tests on the tour to the West Indies in 1934/35, an injury to his knee prevented him from playing in 1935. The next season, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players, he took three quick wickets, bowling Gimblett, Hammond and Hardstaff, to leave the Players at 33-4. Although rain intervened, so the match was drawn, Gubby Allen selected him for the tour to Australia that winter, where he played in the 4th and 5th Tests. His 6-96 in the 5th Test at the MCG could not prevent Australia scoring 604 in their first innings, and so winning the match by an innings and 200 to take the series 3-2. In 1938, Farnes bowled the Gentlemen to their second victory against the Players since 1918, taking 8-43 and 3-60, and he returned to the Test side for 4 Tests against Australia in 1938, and he toured South Africa that winter, opening the bowling in 5 Tests with Hedley Verity. A tall man of 6'5\"", and widely recognised for his fitness, he achieved considerable pace from a short run-up, and sharp lift from a good length. His height also enabled him to take many sharp catches close to the stumps. He was a confirmed tail-ender as a batsman. He achieved his highest first-class score of 97 not out against Somerset at Taunton in 1936, putting on 149 for the tenth wicket and just missing out on his century. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1939, and published an autobiography, Tours and Tests in 1940. He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in the Second World War, and trained in Canada. He was a sergeant prior to being commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 September 1941.

It had a near monopoly in air travel between New York and Florida from the 1930s until the 1950s and dominated this market for decades afterward. Labor disputes and high debt loads strained the company in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the leadership of former astronaut Frank Borman. Frank Lorenzo acquired Eastern in 1985 and moved many of its assets to his other airlines, including Continental Airlines and Texas Air. After continued labor disputes and a crippling strike in 1989, Eastern ran out of money and was liquidated in 1991. American Airlines obtained many of Eastern's routes from Miami to Latin America and the Caribbean, while Delta Air Lines, Eastern's main competitor at Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, acquired many of Eastern's Lockheed L-1011 aircraft. Eastern pioneered hourly air shuttle service between New York City, Washington, DC and Boston in 1961 as the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle.

PAK was also highly critical of the alleged dependence of Greece on foreign powers, namely the USA. Its stated aim was the realization of “radical changes” with the aim of the “socialist transformation of Greece”. Furthermore, PAK’ s stated aim was to become the centre of democratic resistance in Greece. It not only wished for the withdrawal of the Colonel dictatorship, but it also supported a “free, progressive and nationally free” Greece. It claimed that “it would not accept any compromise in any phase of its struggle and that it would fight for a total democratic victory.” After the fall of the junta, many PAK members became prominent members in Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party.",Agent,Organisation,PoliticalParty,Panhellenic_Liberation_Movement,236

Andréasson has created children's comics since 1944, mainly for the Swedish market, but his works have been published in several European countries.

Actually, Walt Disney once offered him work, but Andréasson refused, instead choosing to stay with his own creations. Those included the comic features \""Brum\"", \""Lille Rikard och Hans Katt\"" (Little Rikard and his cat), \""Rulle och Maja\"" (Rulle and Maja), \""Nicke Bock\"" (Nicke goat), \""Åsnan Kal\"" (Kal the donkey), \""Nalle Ritar och Berättar\"" (Nalle draws and tells), \""Teddy\"", \""Habibu\"" and \""Pellefant\"". His most famous creation, however, is \""Bamse\"", created in the 1960s, a cute and often educational comic featuring \""the world's strongest bear\"". This feature was highly successful, and was followed by several animated cartoons, as well as a comic book. The comic book started in 1973, featured exclusively Swedish material, and is still one of Sweden's most popular comic books today. In the 1970s, Andréasson began contracting other artists to do the artwork, while he still wrote the stories and kept a strict editorial control of the contents. For example, he refused to publish commercial ads in a book aimed at children. He was also rather restrictive with using his creations for commercial merchandising (sans for a few exceptional cases).

In the early 1970s, Barbara was played by a succession of actresses, but the actress most associated with the role is Colleen Zenk, who played her since September 1, 1978. Better known as simply Barbara Ryan she is portrayed as a heroine who experienced many tragedies, mostly at the hands of her controlling ex-husband, the villainous James Stenbeck (Anthony Herrera). Over her 32 years on the show, Barbara has been shot through the heart, nearly gored by a bull in Spain, kidnapped 15 times, married nine times, burned in a chemical explosion and jumped out of a three-story window. Originally characterised as the hard-hearted daughter of Jennifer Sullivan, Barbara was transformed when writer Douglas Marland came on board at ATWT in 1985. He decided to make Barbara a \""bitch\"" of sorts, and had her break up long standing couple Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery. This proved to be unpopular, and Marland quickly reverted the character back to being \""good\"" by pairing Barbara with Oakdale police detective (and later chief) Hal Munson (Benjamin Hendrickson). Again, in the early 2000s (decade), writer Hogan Sheffer turned Barbara back into a scheming villain. Burned up in a chemical explosion in 2001 with the actress donning special effects make-up for a full year, Barbara returned to her evil ways and culminated in her committing crimes such as drugging a police officer and hiring a hit man to murder Rose D'Angelo (Martha Byrne). She then kidnapped three of her female adversaries (Emily Stewart, Carly Tenney and Rose D'Angelo).Though the character has since reformed and become a more or less law-abiding presence in Oakdale, she can still be manipulative and devious when she feels she needs to be. Entertainment reporter Lisa Joyner described the character as a \""sultry vixen\"" who'd made the transition from \""helpless victim to scheming villain,\"" whilst TV Guide's Michael Logan called the character Oakdale's \""firecracker.\""",Agent,FictionalCharacter,SoapCharacter,Barbara_Ryan,337

Kunonga was criticised within and outside the Anglican Communion for his ardent support of Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe. This was at a time when other religious leaders in the country, notably the Roman Catholic archbishop, Pius Ncube, were condemning Mugabe's government for its human rights excesses across Zimbabwe. Kunonga has been in and out of ecclesiastical courts since 2005. In 2008 he was officially excommunicated, stripping him of all recognition as a cleric within the global Anglican Communion. He has nevertheless continued as the head of a breakaway faction within Zimbabwe, apparently under the protection of President Mugabe, despite the defection of most of his flock and criticism from international church leaders. A judge ordered in January 2008 that the breakaway Anglican province led by Kunonga must share the use of church buildings with the Anglican Church of the Province of Central Africa loyal to Bishop Sebastian Bakare. In August 2011, the country's Chief Justice ruled that all Anglican property in the Harare diocese was under Kunonga's custody. On 19 November 2012, the Zimbabwe Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice, Luke Malaba, ruled that Kunonga and his followers were no longer part of the Church of the Province of Central Africa and that Kunonga will have to surrender everything that belongs to the church that is in his hands.

The division was originally organized with a small cadre of Regular Army officers, while the soldiers were predominantly Selective Service men drawn from the southeastern United States. After organizing and finishing training, the 81st Division deployed to Europe, arriving on the Western Front in August 1918. Elements of the 81st Division first saw limited action by defending the St. Dié sector in September and early October.

Jamison is a key defender, particularly good against leading players, who has played for several years at the North Ballarat Football Club, with his under-18s football at the North Ballarat Rebels, and then reserves and seniors with the Roosters. Jamison was invited to train with the Carlton Football Club in the 2006/07 offseason, presumably on advice from Carlton assistant coach and outgoing Roosters head coach Gavin Crosisca. Carlton then selected Jamison as a rookie with their second selection in the 2007 AFL rookie draft (17th pick overall).

After the retirement of Anthony Koutoufides, Jamison was promoted to the senior list and made a successful senior debut against Collingwood in Round 18. He began 2008 as a nominated rookie.

309731,"The Australian Patriotic Association is considered the first political party in Australia. It was formed in 1835 by a group of influential colonists of New South Wales which had among its leaders William Wentworth, the son of a convict woman and the publisher of the influential newspaper the Australian; Sir John Jamison, a surgeon and founder of the Agricultural Society; and William Bland, a prominent emancipist doctor. In September 1834 Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer, M.P., wrote from England that the situation in the colony was not well understood in London, and suggested that an organised association should be formed, and that it should appoint a parliamentary agent for New South Wales. This resulted in the formation of the Association in 1835 by Wentworth. Bland was its \""chairman of the committee of correspondence\"" (i.e.: Secretary). The Association sought representative government for the colony with a broad franchise, and was opposed by more conservative free settlers in the colony who, while favouring representative government, sought disenfranchisement of emancipists. The Association had representatives in England to put their case before the British government, which was then considering a new constitution for New South Wales. Bulwer acted as parliamentary agent until 1838, when he was succeeded by Charles Buller. A petition went forward to the British government in 1839. During 1839–1841, Bland wrote letters for the Association which show the constitutional struggles towards autonomy. Bland, as secretary, helped draft two bills for a \""representative constitution\"", which contributed to the drafting of the New South Wales Constitution Act, 1842 (UK) with Bland representing Sydney at its reading and approval passages. The Association also supported the incorporation of the City of Sydney as a municipality, which happened in July 1842 with a broadly based franchise. The colony's 1842 constitution gave to emancipists the same political rights as free settlers, but which was subject to a property test. The right to vote was limited to men with a freehold valued at £200 or a householder paying rent of £20 per year, both very large sums at the time. With its goals partly achieved, the Association disbanded in 1842. The first election under the new constitution took place in 1843, with several of the members of the now-disbanded Association standing, including Wentworth and Bland elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council.",Agent,Organisation,PoliticalParty,Australian_Patriotic_Association,384

Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy born in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. His mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. Due to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius left home and went to seek work in Tripoli, where he was apprenticed to a barber. He converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and became an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him detained. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for apostasy from Islam, convicted and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish friend, who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of Demetrius' confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the judge's own desire to let him go. Finally, Demetrius was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully sang Christian hymns in his way), and publicly executed by beheading; it took three strokes, and his severed head and body, though ordered to be burned, were hidden and preserved by local Christians as relics.",Agent,Cleric,Saint,Demetrius_the_Neomartyr,352

After disbanding Lavender Country in 1976, Haggerty ran two unsuccessful campaigns for political office, once for Seattle City Council and once as an independent candidate for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, and continued to work as a gay rights and anti-racism activist. In 2000, the Journal of Country Music published an article on gay country musicians, focusing in large part on Haggerty and Lavender Country. As a result of the renewed attention, the album was rereleased on CD in December 1999, and in 2000 the band released a five-song EP, Lavender Country Revisited, which featured three rerecordings of songs from the original album and two new songs. The band reunited briefly in 2000, performing the album in its entirety at Seattle's Broadway Performance Hall in January 2000, and at that year's Seattle Pride. In addition, the album was archived at the Country Music Hall of Fame by former Journal of Country Music editor Chris Dickinson. Their song \""Cryin' These Cocksucking Tears\"" was included in the 2012 compilation album Strong Love: Songs of Gay Liberation 1972–1981. The 1973 album was rereleased on independent label Paradise of Bachelors in 2014, and the band have played several reunion shows in 2014 to support the reissue. Haggerty recorded a story for StoryCorps about coming out to his father in 1959, which was adapted into the animated short film The Saint of Dry Creek in 2015. In 2016, director Dan Taberski directed a short film titled These C*cksucking Tears which starred Haggerty and told the story of his life and career.",Agent,Group,Band,Lavender_Country,482

237921,"Olin A. Dutra (January 17, 1901 – May 5, 1983) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1920s and 1930s. He won two major titles, the PGA Championship in 1932 and the U.S. Open in 1934, and was the first major champion born in the western United States. Born in Monterey, California, Dutra was a descendant of early Spanish settlers in California. At age nine, he and his older brother Mortimer were introduced to golf as a caddies at the country club in Del Monte, where the club professional was Macdonald Smith. For years, they woke up very early to practice golf before going to work. In 1923, Dutra resigned from a job at his father's hardware store to become a golf professional and joined the PGA Tour in 1924, where he won 10 tournaments. His best years as a golf professional were in the early 1930s, when he won his two majors and played on the 1933 and 1935 Ryder Cup teams. In the 1932 PGA Championship in St. Paul, Dutra played 196 holes and finished an astounding 19-under-par. He was the medalist in the 36-hole qualifier and won his five matches by comfortable margins (9 & 8, 5 & 3, 5 & 4, 3 & 2, and 4 & 3). Dutra is best remembered for his performance at the 1934 U.S. Open at Merion near Philadelphia. More than a year earlier, Dutra became afflicted with amoebic dysentery, an often uncomfortable and painful intestinal infection. While traveling east from Los Angeles, Dutra stopped in the Detroit area to meet up with his brother Mortie, as both were entered in the Open, and began to feel very ill. He spent a short time in the hospital, casting doubt whether he could even play in the tournament. He resorted to unusual measures to cope with the infection, and lost close to 20 pounds (9 kg) off his 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 230-pound (104 kg) frame. After the first two rounds, Dutra was eight strokes behind the leaders and in 18th place. On the eve of the 36-hole final day, he had an attack of dysentery, forcing him to snack on sugar cubes throughout the day. He was still able to shoot a 71-72, and held off 54-hole leader Gene Sarazen to win by a single stroke. (Mortie Dutra finished tied for 28th.) Dutra began his career as a club pro in Fresno, California at Fort Washington Country Club for several years and then was at Sunnyside Country Club for a year. He won his two majors as the pro at Brentwood Country Club in Los Angeles, and moved over to Wilshire Country Club in 1935. While at Brentwood in 1932, he gave Babe Didrickson a two-minute lesson before she played her \""first\"" round of golf, shortly after the 1932 Olympics; her first tee shot was 240 yards (220 m), outdriving her male playing partners. (It was later revealed she had previous golf experience.) Dutra later worked in Mexico City, then back in California in Avila Beach and Watsonville. He died after an extended illness at age 82 in Newman in Stanislaus County. Dutra and his wife Gladys are buried in the Hills Ferry Cemetery in Newman.",Agent,Athlete,GolfPlayer,Olin_Dutra,543

An administrator, Djimasta held various cabinet positions under Presidents Hissène Habré and Idriss Déby, beginning with his appointment as Minister of Health and Social Affairs in the cabinet created by Habré on October 21, 1982, shortly after his rise to power. After the rise of Déby to power and the legalization of opposition political parties, he became a member of the Union for Democracy and the Republic, founded in 1992, and was a leading figure in the party, together with Jean Alingué Bawoyeu. A shrewd politician, Djimasta was appointed as Minister of the Interior on May 22, 1992, serving in that position until 1993. He headed a commission, composed of representatives of the government, political parties, and civil society, that was responsible for preparing for the Sovereign National Conference; the commission was created by President Déby in November 1992, and its task included the selection of the Conference's delegates. Djimasta was nominated as transitional Prime Minister by Déby on April 8, 1995 and confirmed by the transitional parliament by winning a majority vote of 54 to 36. Déby had become wary of Prime Minister Delwa Kassiré Koumakoye due to the latter's evident presidential ambitions, moving him to search a more malleable Prime Minister, as Djimasta was effectively to prove himself. On August 11, 1996 a new 21-member cabinet was formed, in which he retained the post of Prime Minister. A year later he resigned and on May 17, 1997 his place was taken by Nassour Guelendouksia Ouaido.

217181,"In tennis, the term Big Four refers to the quartet of men's singles players Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray. They reigned as the four best players in the world every season from 2008–2013. These players were considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories, including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events, as well as the ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games. Federer was the first to come to prominence after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004. Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer, and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive weeks from July 2005 to August 2009. Djokovic, from 2007, and later Murray, from 2009, increasingly challenged Federer's and Nadal's dominance with seasonal consistency: Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011, and in 2012 the quartet won one Major tournament apiece. In 2011, Nadal declared that his and Federer's period of joint dominance had ended, owing to the ascent of other players, notably Djokovic and Murray. Since this time the term \""Big Four\"", while used previously, became popular with the media and in tennis literature. The Big Four were a critical part of what has, since 2010, often been labelled a new \""Golden Era\"" in tennis; that term is also applied to the mid-1970s to 1980s, and the 1920s to the 1930s.

They have regularly occupied the top four places in the year-end rankings between 2008 and 2013, with Murray being the only member not to have been ranked world No. 1, having reached a career high No. 2 on several occasions. Of the four, Federer leads with a record 17 Grand Slam tournament titles followed by Nadal (14), Djokovic (12) and Murray (3). Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic have completed a Career Grand Slam by winning each of the four Majors at least once, with Nadal also winning a gold medal at 2008 Summer Olympics for a Career Golden Slam. Murray has won neither the French Open nor the Australian Open, despite reaching the final five times in Melbourne and once in Paris, but has also won two gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Olympics, becoming the first tennis player ever to win two singles gold medals, and the most successful male Olympic tennis player in the modern era with two gold medals and a silver medal.

255682,"José Pérez Colmenares (July 14, 1914 – July 25, 1944) was a baseball pioneer in Venezuela and a member of the National Team that captured the Baseball World Cup in its 1941 edition. Pérez batted and threw lefthanded. He was born in Villa de Cura, Aragua. In his playing days, Pérez was regarded by his versatility to play both outfield corners and first base. A solid average defender with a strong throwing arm, he showed good footwork around first base and was able to pick throws out of the dirt well. Strictly a line-drive hitter with little power, he placed more emphasis on speed and running the bases aggressively. At age 17, Pérez debuted professionally in 1931 in the newly created Liga Nacional de Béisbol, which had stabilized the first national championship of first division in Venezuela since its inauguration in 1930. Pérez moved around for a while, as the circuit shifted players in anytime as needed to help new teams stay afloat. He entered the league with the Latinos BBC, playing for them in his rookie season before joining the Águilas BBC in 1932. After that he had a number of stints with clubs such as Lucana, Senadores, Deportivo Caracas (twice), Cardenales (twice), Valdés (twice) and Magallanes in the next nine seasons spanning 1933–1941. The hard work paid off when Pérez made the Venezuelan pre-selection team in 1941, then was added to the national team roster for the Baseball World Cup tournament to be played in Cuba in October. The Venezuelan team prevailed in six of its seven games, with the only defeat coming to Dominican Republic, before facing the undefeated Cubans in the last game of the schedule. Venezuela closed the tournament with a 4–1 victory over Cuba, a disappointing final for 30,000 people gathered at La Tropical Stadium in Havana. With both clubs tied at 7–1 after more than two weeks of play, the visitors to settle proudly for the result. Nevertheless, the overconfidents Cubans insisted on an extra playoff game, which was played on October 28, 1941. As a result, Daniel Canónico won a pitching duel with Connie Marrero and defeated the Cuban squad by a score of 3–1. This was the first Venezuelan baseball team to win an international tournament, where Pérez drove in five runs and scored 11 times, while hitting a .275 batting average in the nine contests. Following his productive performance in the World Cup, Pérez joined the debuting Cervecería Caracas club during the 1942-43 and 1943-44 First Division tournaments. He won the batting title in his second season for Cervecería, hitting a .456 average in 18 games. He also led the league in hits (31) and runs batted in (13), during what turned out to be his last baseball appearance. Shortly after finishing the 1943-44 season, Pérez died tragically in a plane crash in Barcelona, Anzoátegui, just eleven days after his 30th birthday. The Estadio José Pérez Colmenares, named after him, is a multi-purpose stadium located in Maracay, Aragua.

Bolstering their national reputation for their accurate and powerful interpretation of the genre of social history of the 16th to 19th centuries, the group's repertoire includes popular songs from the English Civil War era to the Victorian period performed on period and electronic instruments. The band members are: \n*  Gregg Butler (vocals, cornett, cittern, recorder, keyed bugle, ophicleide, euphonium) \n*  Malcolm Gibbons (vocals, 12-string guitar, laúd) \n*  Chris Pollington (keyboard, midi horn, accordion, guitar) \n*  Alison Younger (occasional vocalist) The group have engaged in projects associated with disparate musical traditions in British history. In October 2005, Strawhead celebrated the 200th anniversary of 21 October 1805 Battle of Trafalgar through a performance at the 2005 Canalside Festival in the market town of Banbury. Other projects have included music of the English Civil War and the Victorian period. The Fylde Folk Festival website lists \""subjects such as the colonisation of America, the English Civil War, Marlborough’s Wars in the Low Countries, Monmouth’s Rebellion, and drinking songs.\"" According to a BBC review, \""Strawhead have enjoyed considerable success appearing at the top of the bill at most of the UK's major folk festivals, becoming firm favorites among folk fans.\"" In addition, Strawhead has achieved worldwide recognition for their distinctive sound and interpretation of songs. Strawhead fueled some controversy when it made a derivate work from an old ballad entitled \""The Bold Fusilier\"". The Bold Fusilier is a British song which some argue predates the 1903 tune to Waltzing Matilda. Waltzing Matilda is Australia's most widely known folk song, and has been referred to as 'the unofficial national anthem of Australia. There are similarities between Waltzing Matilda and The Bold Fusilier, making for argument that one of the songs is based on the other song. There is no evidence that The Bold Fusilier is older than Waltzing Matilda and Australia and most sources reject the idea that a British song serves as a parent work for the Australian Waltzing Matilda. In the 1970s, Strawhead wrote four more verses for The Bold Fusilier and called their resulting song, The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant. The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant was adopted by a generation of folkies and battle re-enactors. The four additional verses called to mind the Marlborough's Wars of 1702 to 1713. In addition, the Strawhead creation sounded so like a relic of Marlborough's wars that many of the folkies and battle re-enactors came to believe that Strawhead's The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant was from the early 18th century. As a result, folkies and battle re-enactors came to mistakenly believe that the 1903 tune of Waltzing Matilda was borrowed from the 1970s The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant, rather than the reverse, even though the sleeve notes to Strawhead's 1978 record features an explanation of how they developed The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant.

This devotion is predominantly used in the Roman Catholic Church and among some high-church Anglicans and Lutherans. The devotion is especially concerned with what the Church deems to be the love and compassion of the heart of Christ towards humanity, and its long suffering. The origin of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a Roman Catholic nun from France, Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions to her between 1673 and 1675, and later, in the 19th century, from the mystical revelations of another Roman Catholic nun in Portugal, Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart, a religious of the Good Shepherd, who requested, in the name of Christ that Pope Leo XIII consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

William Frederick Deacon was the first child of six born to a fairly prosperous merchant of Tavistock Square, London. After attending Reading School,where his contemporary was Thomas Noon Talfourd, Deacon studied at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where his studies seem to have been desultory. He left without a degree but while at college published a poem : 'Hacho; or the Spell of St. Wilten', an imitation of Sir Walter Scott .Encouraged by the positive reviews of his debut work, Deacon embarked on a prolific literary career. In 1820 and 1821 he was writing under a number of aliases for Gold and Northhouse's London Magazine and Monthly Critical and Dramatic Review, which had been set up as a rival to the more celebrated London Magazine published by Robert Baldwin, and whose other contributors included George Soane and Cornelius Webb.In October 1820 he added to his already taxing work load by editing,and almost wholly writing, a lively daily paper, The Déjeuné, or Companion for the Breakfast Table, extracts from which were frequently featured in Gold's. Unsurprisingly, this latter, rather demanding venture folded in December, and in June 1821 Gold's was itself bought out by the rival London Magazine. Deacon, exhausted by his literary efforts, retired for a while to a cottage in Llangadock, south Wales, from where he wrote to his mentor, Walter Scott,asking for advice on whether to continue as a writer. Scott advised him to pursue a steadier career outside literature, but Deacon ignored this advice and worked up some of the parodic material published in Gold's into his masterpiece, Warreniana, a compendious parodic survey of contemporary writing which imagines a world where the leading writers of the day become hirelings of the blacking (boot polish) manufacturer Robert Warren. The book was generally well received and there were several positive reviews. The Monthly Review praised the 'considerable vivacity and success' of the volume, whilst the London Literary Gazette labelled it a 'cleverly done' jeu d'esprit. His later books include November Nights or Tales for Winter Evenings (1826).

Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors. Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name \""Paul\"" since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul. He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America. Pope Benedict XVI declared that the late pontiff lived a life of heroic virtue and conferred the title of Venerable upon him. Pope Francis beatified him on 19 October 2014 after the recognition of a miracle attributed to his intercession. His liturgical feast is celebrated on the date of his birth on 26 September.",Agent,Cleric,Pope,Pope_Paul_VI,459

Niemi began his career at junior level icing for his local team Ilves Tampere at junior A SM-liiga standard, the highest level of junior ice hockey. In his first season, 1989/90 he featured in 34 games, and helped out the offence with six points. This pushed Ilves into the post-season, where Niemi played on three occasions and also managing his first post-season point. Niemi was a cornerstone of the junior team, playing more than 60 times throughout the 1990/91 and 1991/92 seasons, again making the post-season in 1992 where he scored his first playoff goal. Niemi's chance at senior level came the following season, 1992/93. He alternated between the junior A standard and full SM-liiga level and played 8 times for the full Ilves team, a significant achievement for a twenty-year-old defenceman. Part way through the 1992/93 season however, Niemi made a temporary move to FPS who played at the lower Mestis standard in Niemi's homeland. The defenceman coped well with the change and scored 5 points in 23 games at senior level as well as 3 points in 7 junior contests. For the start of the 1993/94 season, Niemi was an Ilves player and played on five occasions in the SM-liiga. He was sent out to lower division teams again however in order to develop him as a player, this time icing for Hermes Kokkola and KooVee, another team from the city of Tampere. Niemi found himself as a regular player for both teams. His showings at the lower level again persuaded Ilves to recall Niemi to their first team squad for the 1994/95 season. He found only limited opportunities however, playing just five SM-liiga games and making six Liigakarsinta appearances. It was his last season as an Ilves player, as Niemi chose to move to Sweden and Örebro IK. Again he failed to establish himself as a key player, and made just eleven appearances before a mid-season switch to play for the Durham Wasps of the BHL. Niemi played 15 times for the Wasps before the end of the season. Despite a reasonably successful spell in the United Kingdom, Niemi moved to Germany and EV Landsberg. This sparked Niemi's point scoring ability, and in 53 games he scored 41 points, a remarkable total for a defenceman. Niemi remained in Germany for the following season (1997–98), although moved to play for the EV Duisburg organisation. Here he was rather less successful, playing just 16 times and managing just one assist. Niemi failed to gain a contract for fully professional hockey the next year, and returned for the 1999/2000 season as a Herlev Hornets player. The Hornets ice in the highest level of Danish hockey, the Oddset Ligaen. Niemi combined his defensive duties with his offensive talent well for Herlev, scoring 22 points in 42 league games. This success saw Niemi signed by Rungsted IK, again of the Oddset Ligaen for the 2000/01 term. Niemi stayed just one season though before moving back to Herlev, where he again tasted success and helped the team into the post season. Niemi returned to the United Kingdom for the 2003/04 season, and played in the newly formed EIHL for the London Racers in their debut season as an organisation. Niemi played 19 games for the Racers before moving mid-season to another team playing their first season, the Manchester Phoenix. The Phoenix organisation struggled financially however, and at the end of the season had to temporarily terminate playing operations. This prompted Niemi to return to his native Finland and sign for HC Montreal of the Suomi-sarja, the third tier of Finnish ice hockey. Niemi played on ten occasions for Montreal, scoring one point.

He is remembered for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then novel Copernican model. He proposed that the stars were just distant suns surrounded by their own exoplanets and raised the possibility that these planets could even foster life of their own (a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism). He also insisted that the universe is in fact infinite and could have no celestial body at its \""center\"". Beginning in 1593, Bruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition on charges including denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including eternal damnation, the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the virginity of Mary, and transubstantiation. Bruno's pantheism was also a matter of grave concern. The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was burned at the stake in Rome's Campo de' Fiori in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science, although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.Bruno's case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences. In addition to cosmology, Bruno also wrote extensively on the art of memory, a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles. Historian Frances Yates argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by Arab astrology (particularly the philosophy of Averroes), Neoplatonism, Renaissance Hermeticism, and legends surrounding the Egyptian god Thoth. Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.",Agent,Person,Philosopher,Giordano_Bruno,299

Eldrick Tont \""Tiger\"" Woods (born December 30, 1975) is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time. He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years. Following an outstanding amateur and two-year college golf career, Woods turned professional at age 20 in late summer 1996. By April 1997 he had already won his first major, the 1997 Masters, in a record-breaking performance, winning the tournament by 12 strokes and pocketing $486,000. He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997. Through the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf, spending 264 weeks from August 1999 to September 2004 and 281 weeks from June 2005 to October 2010 as World Number One. From December 2009 to early April 2010, Woods took leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity, but he and his wife Elin Nordegren eventually divorced. His many extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several different women, through many worldwide media sources. This was followed by a loss of golf form, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011. He ended a career-high winless streak of 107 weeks when he captured the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011. After winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational on March 25, 2013, he ascended to the No.1 ranking once again, holding the top spot until May 2014.

Their first assignment was Utah and Omaha beaches on 6 June 1944 (the D-Day invasion). The mission of the 621-man assault force was to raise hydrogen-filled barrage balloons to protect assaulting infantry and armor from being strafed by enemy aircraft. A commendation by Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower cited the unit for conducting \""its mission with courage and determination, and proved an important element of the air defense team\"". The battalion served 140 days in France. In late July 1944, Battery A of the 320th moved from Omaha Beach to the port city of Cherbourg. The remaining three batteries stayed on Omaha and Utah Beaches until early October, when deteriorating weather prevented ships from landing. The battalion’s service in France came to and end on October 24, when the men boarded ships bound for England.< The 320th Barrage Balloon Bn. was unique at Normandy for two reasons. First, it was the only American barrage balloon unit in France and second, it was the first black unit in the segregated American Army to come ashore on D-Day. Five battalion medics were the first to land on Omaha Beach at approximately 9 a.m. A wounded medic, Waverly B. Woodson Jr., was nominated for the Medal of Honor, though he never received it. The VLA in the 320th designation stood for \""very low altitude.\"" These units used smaller barrage balloons that could easily be moved by a few men and transported across the channel on landing craft. A standard balloon crew was normally five men, but the 320th reduced crews to three and four men for the Normandy invasion. Corporal William G. Dabney is one of the last surviving members of this unit, and received the French Legion of Honor in 2009 for his participation in the Invasion of Normandy.",Agent,Organisation,MilitaryUnit,320th_Barrage_Balloon_Battalion,322

301554,"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011.

It took part in the 2006 Dutch election under the leadership of Marco Pastors and Joost Eerdmans, but a dismal election result leaves the political future of the party quite uncertain. The party is seen as one of the political heirs of the late Pim Fortuyn. The Eén in the name Eén NL, meaning 'one', emphasizes national unity where NL is the standard abbreviation of the Netherlands. The party broadly stands for opposition to mass immigration to the Netherlands, tax cutting and shrinking government, zero tolerance on crime, constitutional reform (particularly more direct democracy and the direct election of the prime minister and members of parliament), restoring the \""human dimension\"" in large public sectors such as education and health care, and a skeptical attitude to European integration. Although the party is critical of the \""islamization\"" of the Netherlands, in favor of the assimilation of minorities and opposed to further immigration, it is perceived as taking a less hard line on this issue than other right-wing parties such as Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom or Hilbrand Nawijn's Party for the Netherlands. Several moderate Muslims support the party. On September 20, 2006, Anton van Schijndel, formerly of the VVD, joined the party and on September 24 he and Eerdmans formed a new parliamentary group with the provisional name Groep Eerdmans-Van Schijndel. The definitive list of candidates was presented on September 30, 2006.

The party program was presented on October 9, 2006, and in November 2006 Marco Pastors published a political pamphlet as well. On November 15, the party released a radio advert, in which party leader Marco Pastors likened the apathy of \""the establishment\"" towards the \""Islamization of Holland\"" to the laxism of Dutch politics towards the Nazi threat from Germany in the 1930s.

He believed von Hassell would be receptive to the idea of a pact between Britain and Germany at the outbreak of World War II.

313956,"Gyratory System is a three-piece music band based in London. It is fronted by producer/trumpet player Andrew Blick. Blick was a session musician in the 1990s and previously a member of One More Grain. His trumpet-playing style, which involves the heavy use of electronic treatments, has been likened to 'Miles Davis circa On The Corner, Andy Diagram or Jon Hassell'. Another journalist has written: 'A British experimental legend, producer Andrew Blick’s three piece must be the UK’s only acid-fried, horn-led electronic marching band'. Gyratory System's music is created using a technique called 'The Process'. The resulting sound has been compared to electronica, krautrock, post-punk and avant-garde classical music. Paul Lester of the Guardian wrote: 'You may be able to detect the influence of composers such as Steve Reich here, and it may sound ultra cerebral, but...this is seriously danceable stuff...If anything, this music recalls the experimental early-80s \""avant-funk\"" of the likes of A Certain Ratio and, in particular, 23 Skidoo'. Also in The Guardian, Alex Miller, awarding the band's release Sea Containers House 'single of the week' on 19 September 2009, stated: 'Maybe when the industry catches up with them and 2011 is rammed with music that sounds like a neurotic death rave of farting Klangers I'll resent them, but until then this is what I'm all about. Sing along everybody! Fart, clunk, parp!' The debut Gyratory System album, The Sound-Board Breathes, was released in October 2009. It was praised by critics, John Doran for the BBC describing it as a 'superb album, sounding like little else released this year'. NME rated it 8/10. In 2010, Dazed Digital described the album as 'one of last year’s most essential records'. Gyratory System has received strong radio support, including sessions for XFM and BBC 6Music. The band has toured the UK as a headline act and supported Soulwax/2manydjs. Gyratory System's second album, New Harmony, is released on 16 April January 2011, on Angular Recording Corporation. On 24 January 2011 NME rated 'Pamplona', taken from New Harmony, as one of its '10 tracks you have to hear this week', describing Gyratory System as 'wonderfully warped electronica...allow your neurons to be frazzled'. In an early review of New Harmony the music critic Everett True wrote 'I love this music...it bounces and quirks like a wind-up set of chattering teeth'.",Agent,Group,Band,Gyratory_System,385

Pete Seeger was a regular visitor to the camp and encouraged the group. Founding members of the group were Jerry Gray (banjo and lead singer), Sid Dolgay (mando-cello), and the singers Helen Gray, Jerry Goodis, and Oscar Ross. In 1961 Jerry Goodis was replaced by Ray Woodley. In 1965 they were joined by singer Joe Hampson, husband of Sharon Hampson of Sharon, Lois & Bram fame.

(The initial \""I\"" in the logo looked like an exclamation point, but the name of the imprint was not !mpact.) Impact's titles featured the adventures of revamped versions of superheroes licensed from Archie Comics including the Fly, the Comet, the Shield, the Jaguar, the Web, and the Black Hood. Changes included making the new Jaguar a woman and making the Web an organization instead of a solo hero. This was the third attempt to revive the old Archie heroes, after the Mighty Comics line of the 1960s and the Red Circle line of comics in the early 1980s. In an effort to reach out to kids who were not aware of the direct market system, DC Comics attempted to sell Impact Comics titles through newsstands, however that never happened. The imprint eventually collapsed due to poor sales. A final series The Crucible was initially intended to relaunch the line, but instead served as its finale.

For most of its history, Braathens was the largest domestic airline in Norway, but did not operate an international network for many years. Its main hubs were Oslo Airport, Fornebu and later Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, and briefly Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. The airline operated 118 aircraft of 15 models, the majority of aircraft which have been variations of the Boeing 737. Braathens served 53 airports and 50 cities with scheduled services through its history. The airline was founded in 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen and originally used a fleet of Douglas DC-4 aircraft on routes to the Far East and South Africa. From 1954 the airline was forced to operate all its scheduled flights domestically, where it used de Havilland Herons. Braathens SAFE retained an international charter service using the DC-3 and DC-6. As new domestic airports were built, Braathens SAFE and SAS were awarded each their share of monopoly route concessions. The Fokker F-27 was introduced in 1958, but was phased out with the delivery of the Fokker F-28 and Boeing 737-200 jets from 1969. The last F-27 was phased out in 1975. After a two-year use of Boeing 767 aircraft, Braathens operated an all-Boeing 737 fleet from 1986. Increased domestic competition on routes started from 1987, along with Braathens SAFE again starting international routes. By 1994 the fleet had been replaced with Boeing 737-400 and -500 and domestic deregulation of the airline market was introduced. Braathens followed up by listing itself on the Oslo Stock Exchange, joining an alliance with Dutch airline KLM and expanding its operations to Sweden through purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. The 1998 opening of Gardermoen resulted in an intense price war with SAS and Color Air, from which Braathens never recovered financially.

New College was founded as Turton Hall School in 1850 and transferred from Gildersome to Harrogate in 1898. Rev John Haslam DD was Proprietor/Headmaster of Turton Hall School from 1873 and when the lease ran out in 1898 he purchased land and built New College in Harrogate for £10,000. He became the Principal of New College (and his painting dominated the dining hall) and his son W. J. Haslam became headmaster. New College was located 20 minutes' walk from Harrogate railway station, in one of the healthiest part of town. It was situated on the brow of a hill, sloping southward, about 450 feet above sea level, and commanding extensive views of the district. In 1900 the New College estate comprised 34 acres and included a vegetable garden, a farm, two Fives Courts (35 x 28), a Gymnasium (60 x 16), a Workshop, 2 Tennis Courts, a Cinder Court and a bicycle track. The Boys' Department comprised a large Dining Hall and Assembly Room (50 x 22), with a raised platform for Choir and Organ for Divine Service, Three Class Rooms, a School Parlour, a Library, a Music Room, a Laboratory, a Bath and Dressing Room, Lavatory, Boot and Two Cloak Rooms. The Senior Dormitory was fitted with dressing cubicles as recommended by Dr. Clement Dukes in his work on Health at School, and adopted at The Leys School, Cambridge. There was an Intermediate Dormitory and two smaller dormitories for younger boys. All the rooms were heated with hot water pipes, and ventilated on the most approved principles. Special attention was given to the sanitary arrangements. Rev Haslam continued to be Principal until his death in 1917 when he was buried at Harlow Hill Cemetery. After the First World War New College experienced a short-term boom, and from 1919 to 1923 more than a hundred boys were in residence. A Common Room and Library were added in 1920 and a Gymnasium in 1926. Typically trips were arranged abroad (for masters and boys) to climb the Matterhorn or to fly to Paris, on a Handley Page aircraft, from Croydon airport. At the end of the summer term 1927 W. J. Haslam retired and was succeeded by R. H. F. Coleman. Numbers were already falling due to the Great Depression and the end came quickly. As Ashville College was considering a new school for juniors an arrangement for the union of Ashville and New College in April 1930. The school could accommodate 80 boys and stood in a wooded estate of 27 acres and included a gym, extensive playing fields, a quad and a \""Jungle\"". The acquisition of New College by Ashville College proved to be of value. Boys received a first-class education until their thirteenth year when they were transferred to Ashville College. As the two schools were closely associated there was no danger of a violent break. Placing Prep and Senior Schools under one control was increasingly recognised, at this time, by Public Schools.

245728,"Yim Wing Chun (simplified Chinese: 严咏春; traditional Chinese: 嚴詠春; pinyin: Yányǒngchūn) is a Chinese legendary character, often cited in Wing Chun legends as the first master of the martial art bearing her name. Wing Chun, though a person's name in Chinese language, translates literally to \""spring chant\"" or \""forever spring\"", or may be substituted with the character for \""eternal springtime\"". Different accounts of Yim Wing Chun's story exist, but the central sequence of events remains largely the same, beginning with the origin of her teacher. During the Qing Dynasty, a Shaolin Buddhist nun and abbess, Ng Mui (五枚師太), reportedly fled the destruction of the Siu Lam temple at the hands of the government; the temple was believed to be harbouring revolutionaries. According to one legend, after being inspired by witnessing a crane and a snake fighting, Ng Mui incorporated their movements into her style of Chinese kung fu to form a new, yet-unnamed martial art system. Ng Mui later took on a disciple, Yim Wing Chun, and passed the art on to her. Yim Wing Chun was well known for her beauty and sold tofu for a living. A local bully tried to force her to marry him, but she used the art to defeat him. Some accounts claim that Ng Mui taught Yim the art specifically for the purpose of defending herself against the man's unwanted advances. Yim Wing Chun later married Leung Bok-chau, a salt merchant, who named the art \""Wing Chun Kuen\"" (Wing Chun Fist) after her. Lee (1972) attributes significant development of the art to Yim Wing Chun, crediting her with the invention of the Chi Sao (sticking hands) exercise. From there, the art passed through several men's hands before coming to Yip Man. The movie Wing Chun (1994) loosely portrays Yim Wing Chun's life within the action film genre, with Michelle Yeoh portraying the central character. A more recent movie, Kung Fu Wing Chun (2010), Yim Wing Chun was portrayed by Bai Jing and Leung Bok-chau was portrayed by Yu Shaoqun.Meng and Rudnicki (2006) have written a critical analysis of the legend surrounding Yim Wing Chun.",Agent,Athlete,MartialArtist,Yim_Wing-chun,351

It was formerly the senior partner of the governing Red-Green Coalition, and its former leader, Jens Stoltenberg, is the former Prime Minister of Norway. The party is currently led by Jonas Gahr Støre. The Labour Party is officially committed to social-democratic ideals. Its slogan since the 1930s has been \""everyone shall take part\"", and the party traditionally seeks a strong welfare state, funded through taxes and duties. Since the 1980s, the party has included more of the principles of a social market economy in its policy, allowing for privatization of government-held assets and services and reducing income tax progressivity, following the wave of economic liberalization in the 1980s. During the first Stoltenberg government, the party's policies were inspired by Tony Blair's New Labour and saw the most widespread privatization by any Norwegian government to that date. The party has frequently been described as increasingly neoliberal since the 1980s, both by political scientists and opponents on the left. The Labour Party profiles itself as a progressive party that subscribes to cooperation on a national as well as international level. Its youth wing is the Workers' Youth League. The party is a full member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance, and is an observer member of the Socialist International. The Labour Party has always been a strong supporter of Norway's NATO membership and has supported Norwegian membership in the European Union during two referendums. During the Cold War, when the party was in government most of the time, the party closely aligned Norway with the United States at the international level and followed an anti-communist policy at the domestic level, in the aftermath of the 1948 Kråkerøy speech and culminating in Norway being a founding member of NATO in 1949. Founded in 1887, the party steadily increased in support until it became the largest party in Norway in 1927, a position it has held ever since. This year also saw the consolidation of conflicts surrounding the party during the 1920s following its membership in the Comintern from 1919 to 1923. It formed its first government in 1928, and has led the government for all but 16 years since 1935. From 1945 to 1961, the party had an absolute majority in the Norwegian parliament, the only time this has ever happened in Norwegian history. The domination by the Labour Party, during the 1960s and early 1970s, was initially broken by competition from the left, primarily from the Socialist People's Party. From the end of the 1970s however, the party started to lose voters to the right, leading to a turn to the right for the party under Gro Harlem Brundtland during the 1980s. In 2001 the party achieved its worst electoral results since 1924. Between 2005 and 2013, Labour returned to power after committing to a coalition agreement with other parties in order to form a majority government.

He was thus second cousin to the writer Anthony Trollope, as well as a cousin to future Bishop of Winchester, Anthony Wilson Thorold. Educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, he returned to Lincolnshire to become vicar of Rauceby in 1841. In 1843, his maternal relative, Sir John Thorold, appointed him to the rectory of Leasingham, Lincolnshire, and he held this living for fifty years. In 1867, he was collated to the archdeaconry of Stow. The high point of his career in the church came in 1877, when he was made Bishop of Nottingham. It was to a large extent the result of Edward Trollope’s hard work, as a fund raiser, that the new see of Southwell, was established in 1884. Despite Trollope’s efforts at the restoration of the Great Hall, next to Southwell Minster, as a Bishop’s Palace, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners thought it unfit for purpose and the first Bishop of Southwell lived for a time at Thurgarton Priory. Trollope was particularly interested in architecture and antiquities. He became a member of the Lincoln Diocesan Architectural Society in 1855, and became its editorial secretary in 1857 and its Chairman in 1867.

200758,"Pope John V of Alexandria, 72nd Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark.He was initially a monk in the Monastery of Saint John the Dwarf in Scetes. He was enthroned as a Pope of Alexandria on the second day of Pi Kogi Enavot, 863 A.M. (25 August 1147). During his papacy, the Copts were persecuted by the Muslim governors and Caliphs. Many were killed and sold as slaves. Several churches in Cairo, such as the church of Saint Menas in Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum) and the church of El-Zohari, were plundered and destroyed. They were later rebuilt by the Coptic layman Abu El-Fakhr Salib Ibn Mikhail. It was also at this time (1164 AD) that Saint Bashnouna was killed by the Muslims. According to the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria, the Emperor of Ethiopia wrote to John in 1152 for a new abuna or Metropolitan, because Abuna Mikael was too old; his request was denied.

256007,"A switch hitter, Gaspar played for the New York Mets (1969–70) and San Diego Padres (1971, 1974). A former player at Long Beach State and Long Beach City College, Gaspar played 178 games in his career, 118 of them in his rookie year, 1969. He began the year as the Mets’ starting right fielder, then became a utility outfielder (he also played left and center field on occasion) after Ron Swoboda became the regular right fielder. That year, he hit .228, recorded in 14 of his 17 career runs batted in, and hit his only Major League home run, off Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants on May 30. He also excelled defensively, leading all Mets outfielders in assists with 12, and leading the National League in double plays with six. That year, Gaspar was a member of the Miracle Mets team that unexpectedly won the World Series in five games over the Baltimore Orioles. In Game Four of that Series, Gaspar scored the winning run on a controversial play at Shea Stadium. With the score tied at 1-1 in the bottom of the tenth, Gaspar pinch-ran for Jerry Grote, who had led off the inning with a double. An intentional walk to Al Weis followed, after which J. C. Martin, pinch-hitting for Tom Seaver, bunted to the pitcher. Both runners advanced, and as Martin ran to first, Pete Richert's throw hit him on the hand and ricocheted away, the error allowing Gaspar to score the winning run. (Replays would later show that Martin had been running inside the baseline, which could have resulted in him being called out for interference; however, the umpires said they didn’t make the call because they felt Martin didn’t intentionally interfere with the play.) Gaspar's son Cade also achieved some measure of distinction as a baseball player. Cade Gaspar played college ball at Saddleback College for two years before becoming a West Coast Conference All-Star with Pepperdine University in 1994, and the Detroit Tigers selected him with the eighteenth overall pick in the first round of the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft.

198426,"Eleazar (pronounced /ɛliˈeɪzər/; Hebrew: אֶלְעָזָר, Modern Elʻazar, Tiberian Elʻāzār; \""El has helped\"") or Elazar was a priest in the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament), the second Kohen Gadol (High Priest), succeeding his father Aaron after Aaron's death. He was a nephew of Moses. Eleazar played a number of roles during the course of the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, from creating the plating for the altar from the firepans of Korah's assembly, to performing the ritual of the Red Heifer. After the death of his older brothers Nadab and Abihu, he and his younger brother Ithamar were appointed to the charge of the sanctuary. His wife, a daughter of Putiel, bore him Phinehas, who would eventually succeed him as Kohen Gadol. Leviticus 10:16-18 records an incident when Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, for failing to eat a sin offering inside the Tabernacle in accordance with the regulations set out in the preceding chapters of Leviticus regarding the entitlement of the priests to a share of the offerings they made on behalf of the Israelite people. As the Israelites moved through the wilderness during the Exodus journey, Eleazar was responsible for carrying the oil for the lampstand, the sweet incense, the daily grain offering and the anointing oil, and also for oversight of the carriage of the Ark of the Covenant, table for showbread, altar and other Tabernacle fittings which were transported by the Kohathite section of the Levite tribe. Following the rebellion against Moses' leadership recorded in Numbers 16, Eleazar was charged with taking the rebels' bronze censers and hammering them into a covering for the altar, to act as a reminder of the failed rebellion and the restriction of the priesthood to the Aaronid dynasty. On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from his father Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest's office, before Aaron's death. Eleazar held the office of high priest for more than twenty years. He took part with Moses in numbering the people, and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest. When he died, he \""was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim\"". The Hill of Phinehas related in the Bible is associated with the location of the village of Awarta in the Samarian section of the current day West Bank. Due to the uncertain security situation, the Israel Defense Forces limit visits to the site by Jews to one annual night close to the 5th of Shevat (around January–February) on the Hebrew calendar.. The high-priesthood remained in the family of Eleazar until the time of Eli, into whose family it passed. Eli was a descendant of Ithamar, Eleazar's brother. The high priesthood was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok after Abiathar was cast out by Solomon. According to Samaritan sources, a civil war broke out between the Sons of Ithamar and the Sons of Phinehas - which resulted in the division of those who followed Eli and those who followed High Priest Uzzi ben Bukki at Mount Gerizim Bethel (a third group followed neither). Likewise according to Samaritan sources, the high-priestly line of the sons of Phinehas died out in 1624 C.E. with the death of the 112th High Priest Shlomyah ben Pinhas, when the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Itamar; see article Samaritan for list of High Priests from 1613 to 2004-the 131st High priest of the Samaritans is Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq.",Agent,Cleric,Saint,Eleazar,601

At the age of 10, he scored 156 in an inter-school match. He represented Bombay University at cricket between 1941/42 and 1946/47. On his collegiate debut, he hit 274, which was then a record. He underwent training at Alf Gover's cricket school. Picked for the Indian tour of Australia in 1947/48, Phadkar shone more with the bat than the ball. On his debut on a difficult wicket at Sydney he hit 51 while batting at eight and took 3 for 14. Promoted to No.6, he scored 123 at Adelaide and added a record 188 for the sixth wicket with Vijay Hazare. Phadkar went on to top the batting averages and scored at least a fifty in all the four Tests that he played. Next year against West Indies at Madras, Phadkar took 7 for 159 which remained his best figures in Tests. But his efforts at bowling bouncers in this match led to the West Indian bowlers reacting in kind and the defeat of India. In the exciting last Test where India needed 361 and ended up six runs short, Phadkar hit 37 not out. His other major innings was 115 against England in 1951/52. When India lost disastrously in England in 1952, he was one of the few players to come out with some credit. At Leeds where India lost the first four wickets before scoring a run, Phadkar and Hazare added 105 for the sixth wicket. Phadkar played in 13 unofficial Tests. He played all the ten Tests against the touring Commonwealth teams in 1949/50 and 1950/51. In the former series where India used four captains, Phadkar led the team in the final Test. He made his first class debut at the age of 17 and went on to captain Bombay in 1950/51. Against Maharashtra in 1948/49 - a match in which 2376 runs were scored - he hit 131 and 160, and took 3/142 and 3/168. His highest first class score was 217 scored against Maharashtra in 1950/51 out of a Bombay total of 725 for 8. He played in the Lancashire League for Nelson, and for Rochdale in the Central Lancashire League. He was a national selector in the 1970s. MCC made him a life member in 1968. He worked for Tata & Sons in Bombay and also for the Railways. After retirement he ran a kindergarten school with his wife in Behala, Calcutta, called Sunny Preparatory School.

Egan-Jones positions itself as unique among nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) for being wholly investor-supported, a structure designed to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest in assessing credit quality. The firm was granted NRSRO status on December 21, 2007, making it the ninth such organization to be recognized by the SEC. The effectiveness of Egan-Jones' investor-supported credit ratings has been measured by third parties, including Richard D. Johnson of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, the Stanford University Business School and the University of Michigan's Business School. Sean Egan, principal of Egan-Jones Rating, appeared before Congress on October 22, 2008 and argued that issuers of complex securities \""shopped\"" for ratings which resulted in a race to the bottom in terms of credit transparency. Rather than \""beat up Moody's and S&P for behavior\"" they'd been financially motivated to pursue, the government needs to support a new business model paid for by investors, not issuers, to support the funding ecosystem which has so severely broken down, he asserted.Egan-Jones on July 16, 2011, became the first NRSRO to cut its rating on the United States from AAA to AA+.On April 5, 2012, Egan-Jones downgraded the credit ranking of the United States for the second time (and within one year) from AA+ (Excellent) to AA (Very Good) assuming that the debt will reach $16.7 trillion by the end of 2012 while the GDP will not grow further $15.7 trillion limit and the debt to the GDP ratio will reach 112% of the national GDP which is the highest level since the WW II. On September 14, 2012, Egan-Jones downgraded the credit rating of the United States for the third time from AA to AA-, the lowest of what is considered \""high grade\"", as a reaction to QE3.

274598,"Duncan Hamilton (born December 1958) is a British author and newspaper journalist and two-time winner of the prestigious William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. Hamilton won the first William Hill Sports Book Award with the 2007 memoir Provided You Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years With Brian Clough., an account of his time at the Nottingham Evening Post where he worked for more than 20 years. The book also won the 'Best Football Book' category of the 2008 British Sports Book Awards. He was the paper's Nottingham Forest reporter during the club's glory years and covered both of Forest's historic victorious European Cup campaigns (1979 and 1980) for the newspaper. During his time covering Forest, Hamilton developed a close, if at times testy, relationship with the club's famously outspoken manager, Brian Clough. Some accounts even claim that Clough hated Hamilton. In Provided You Don't Kiss Me, Hamilton claims he bonded with Clough after the manager learned he, like Clough, was from the north-east of England. He provides an eyewitness account of the relationship between Clough and his assistant, Peter Taylor, and charts Clough's demise and descent into alcoholism. FHM called the book a \""superb portrait of the conflicted, contradictory man [that] doesn't duck his uglier aspects.\"" It quickly became a bestseller and won the William Hill award against very strong competition. After winning the £18,000 first prize, Hamilton wrote a column for the Yorkshire Post, where he currently works as a deputy editor, expressing his surprise and delight at the book's success. In 2009, Hamilton won a second William Hill Sports Book of the Year award for his work on cricketer Harold Larwood; a biography of the outstanding fast bowler Harold Larwood, who was a protagonist in the controversial 'Bodyline' series between Australia and England in 1932-33.

202197,"Ealdred (or Aldred; died 11 September 1069) was Abbot of Tavistock, Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York in Anglo-Saxon England. He was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period. After becoming a monk at the monastery at Winchester, he was appointed Abbot of Tavistock Abbey in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served Edward the Confessor, the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, Edward the Exile, back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king. In 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so. As administrator of the Diocese of Hereford, he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, a Welsh ruler. In 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York, but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of Wulfstan as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood. Some sources state that following King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned Harold Godwinson as King of England. Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred backed Edgar the Ætheling and then endorsed King William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the time of his death in 1069.
