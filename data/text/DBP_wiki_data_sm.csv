143576,"Bukkehåmmårtjørna is a small lake in eastern Jotunheimen. This is the highest lake that has been investigated as a climate archive in southern Norway, being situated 1594 m above sea level. A small glacier, Bukkehåmmårbreen, is draining meltwater into the lake at present. This glacier reformed just short of 6,000 years ago following the Holocene climate optimum and has existed continuously since. After growing gradually towards 4,000 years before present (BP) the glacier has been of near present size over the last 4,000 years, growing slightly larger over the last 2-2,500 years. Prior to the climate optimum and following the deglaciation the glacier melted some 10,000 years before present. The flat valley-shoulder that the lake is eroded into is locally known as a \""fly\"". This particular level at about 1600 m a.s.l. and is believed to have been formed between 100 and 85 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. Standing on the shore-line of Bukkehåmmårtjørna thus means that you are standing on the remnants of a landscape that the Dinosaurs ruled. The small lake existed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum since it contains organic material older than 30,000 years old. Currently being reassessed, growing evidence now indicates that much of the landscape that can be seen from this site is practically unchanged since the age of the Mammoth who lived on the wide plateaus more than 40,000 years ago. The view from the lake, or higher up on the mountain-peak Høgdebrotet therefore includes a view into the landscapes of the distant past, including the landscape of the dinosaurs, the pre-ice age landscape, the landscape of the Mammoth during the last glacial period. By squinting your eyes and imagining the present forest-limit below, located some 300 m higher than at present and by imagining the glaciers of Leirungsalpene being absent you can also see the landscape as it was 7,000 years ago.",Place,BodyOfWater,Lake,Bukkehåmmårtjørna,313

155091,"12374 Rakhat, provisional designation 1994 JG9, is an eccentric, stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 15 May 1994, by American astronomer and software engineer Charles de Saint-Aignan at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,487 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.31 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 40 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in May 2010. It gave a rotation period of 18.1702±0.0205 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.31 in magnitude (U=2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.21, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 4.4 kilometers.

Its source is near Tilling Springs to the north of Leith Hill at grid reference TQ143437 and it runs through Friday Street, Abinger Hammer, Gomshall, Shere, Albury, Chilworth and Shalford. The source is a semi-natural uninhabited area. The catchment is situated on sandstone which has a low rate of weathering. The Tillingbourne is 18 km (11 mi) in length. The Tillingbourne initially flows northward for 4 km (2.5 mi) down the northern slopes of Leith Hill over a series of weirs and cascades, before turning west to run for 14 km (8.7 mi) through Abinger Hammer and Chilworth towards the River Wey at Shalford. The river is classified as a subsequent stream, since its course is determined by the direction of the stratum of softer rock for the majority of its length. The river has four principal tributaries: the Friday Street stream joins at Wootton House; the Holmbury St Mary stream joins at Abinger Hammer; the Sherbourne Brook drains the Silent Pool and Sherbourne Pond and the Law Brook joins near Postford. The river used to power a number of gunpowder, paper and flour mills in the area. The gunpowder mill was at Chilworth. Present day users include a trout farm, watercress beds,a business growing reeds and is often studied by students from nearby field studies centres, such as Sayers Croft and Juniper Hall. The river passes through the Albury estate at: Albury Park, Weston fishery, Vale End fishery and Powder Mills fishery. The rivers course has been diverted slightly here for the purpose of the estate. The River Tillingbourne supports a healthy fish population of both wild brown trout and coarse fish. The Environment Agency has been working with local fishermen to improve the habitat for these fish by recreating a pool and riffle habitat and by cutting back overhanging vegetation. The river was championed by the Victorian landscapist Lewis Pinhorn Wood, who lived in Shere from 1884 to 1897, and painted extensively along its banks with scenes including The Silent Pool, Twilight (1888) and Evening on the Tillingbourne (1889).",Place,Stream,River,River_Tillingbourne,366

151902,"Meridian 5 (Russian: Меридиан-5), also known as Meridian No.15L, was a communications satellite launched by the Russian Federal Space Agency which was lost in a launch failure in December 2011. The fifth Meridian spacecraft to be launched, Meridian 5 was to have been deployed into a Molniya orbit with an apogee of 39,000 kilometres (24,000 mi), a perigee of 900 kilometres (560 mi) and 65 degrees of orbital inclination; from which it would have provided communications for the Russian military. It would have been operated by the newly formed Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. Meridian 5 was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with a Fregat upper stage, from Site 43/4 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The launch took place at 12:08 UTC on 23 December 2011, with the rocket performing nominally during first and second stage flight. At 288 seconds after launch, the Blok I third stage's RD-0124 engine ignited to begin its burn. During third stage flight, an anomaly occurred which prevented the rocket from reaching orbit. An official spokesman stated that the launch had been terminated 421 seconds into flight, by means of the rocket's thrust termination system. Telemetry recorded by NPO Lavochkin, however, indicated that the rocket had veered off course 425 seconds after launch, with data suggesting that there had been an explosion. Another report indicated that the engine had lost thrust 427 seconds after launch. It was the first orbital launch to be conducted by the Aerospace Defence Forces, which had been formed at the beginning of the month.

153019,"(6178) 1986 DA is a metallic asteroid, classified as near-Earth object of the Amor group, approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 February 1986, by Japanese astronomer Minoru Kizawa at Shizuoka Observatory, Japan. As an eccentric Amor asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.1901 AU (28,400,000 km) and approaches the orbit of Earth from the outside but does not cross it. It crosses however the orbit of Mars and can be classified as a Mars-crosser and also approaches the orbit of Jupiter within 0.5 AU. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.5 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,732 days). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 9 years prior to its discovery. It was most probably formed from a larger body through a catastrophic collision with another object. Radar measurements of this body indicate that the surface is relatively smooth on scales of less than a meter, but it is highly irregular on scales of 10–100 meters. Several light-curve analysis gave it a concurring rotation period of 3.50 to 3.51 hours with a relatively high brightness amplitude between 0.03 and 0.48 in magnitude, indicating an irregular shape (U=3/3/n.a.). The metallic M-type asteroid is notable for being significantly more radar-reflective than other asteroids. Radar measurements suggest it is composed of nickel and iron and that it was derived from the center of a much larger object that experienced melting and differentiation. The observed radar albedo was 0.58 and the optical albedo was 0.14. According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.08 and 0.16, and a diameter of 3.1 to 3.2 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link selects 3.15 kilometers as best result, while the first estimate from 1994 gave a diameter of 2.3 kilometers. The asteroid achieved its most notable recognition when scientists revealed that it contained over \""10,000 tons of gold and 100,000 tons of platinum\"", or an approximate value at the time of its discovery of \""$90 billion for the gold and a cool trillion dollars for the platinum, plus loose change for the asteroid's 10 billion tons of iron and a billion tons of nickel.\"" In 2012 the estimated value of 100,000 tons of platinum was worth approximately five trillion US dollars.

It is a cave with large caverns, grottos and lakes. The anhydrite has formed gypsum on the surface due to the air moisture in the cave and, as a result, has increased in volume. The resulting layers of gypsum gradually separate from the underlying rock and hang like wallpaper from the walls and ceilings of the underground caverns. It was discovered in 1865 as a gallery was being driven during prospecting work for kupferschiefer, a copper-bearing shale or bituminous marl. By 1866 it had been developed and opened as a show cave under the name of Falkenburg Cave (Falkenburger Höhle). It has a floor area of about 25,000 m². Of interest to visitors are the underground lakes whose gypsum content gives them an iridescent green colour, and a human made stone construction, known as Barbarossa's Table and Chair (Tisch und Stuhl von Barbarossa).

Launched during the Oslo Airport location controversy during the second half of the 1980s, its main purpose was to act as a airport rail link to serve the proposed national airport on Hurumlandet. The main proposal for the line called for a 14-kilometer (8.7 mi) section of double track which would branch from the Spikkestad Line at Hallenskog. Construction of the Hurum Line would have seen 7 kilometers (4.3 mi) of the Spikkestad Line upgraded to double track as well as upgrades to the Drammen Line. The distance from Hurum to Oslo is 45 kilometers (28 mi), with travel time estimated at 35 minutes. Alternative proposals were also made, such as building a bridge over the Oslofjord and connecting it to the Østfold Line, or the use of coaches and hovercraft. There were also proposals for a monorail and a maglev service. The new airport was in 1992 instead chosen to be located at Gardermoen, resulting in the construction of the Gardermoen Line and the abandonment of any plans for building a railway to Hurum.",Place,RouteOfTransportation,RailwayLine,Hurum_Line,195

It was discovered on 25 June 1987, by Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos at South Bohemian Kleť Observatory in the Czech Republic. The C-type asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, the most prominent family of otherwise stony asteroids in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,550 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 15° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1951, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 36 years prior to its discovery. In February 2008, a photometric light-curve analysis by Slovak astronomer Adrián Galád at the Modra Observatory gave a rotation period of 4.171±0.003 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 in magnitude (U=3). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 (which is typical for stony asteroids and contradicts its C-type classification) and calculates a diameter of 9.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.5. Alternatively, based NASA's generic magnitude-to-size conversion table, and assuming a rather typical albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.05, the body's diameter would increase to 19 kilometers. The minor planet was named in memory of American actor and dancer James Cagney (1899–1986), remembered best for playing multifaceted tough guys in movies such as The Public Enemy (1931) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938).

Finley is a 126 bed, non-profit hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and has been licensed by the state of Iowa. In 2016, Finley Hospital welcomed patients to a multi-phase project that provides a 70,000 square foot, 3-story addition located on the Grandview Avenue side of the current Finley Hospital building. The building houses the Emergency Department, surgical suites and Heart and Vascular Center, improving health care delivery for the community. History The hospital was founded in 1890 when Mrs. Helen Finley bequeathed her estate towards the founding of a hospital in memory of her husband Dr. John Finley. Dr. Finley was Dubuque's first general physician and the second permanent physician of both the county of Dubuque and the state of Iowa. He had the reputation for being a kind man with a deep, invested interest in his patients. This was a well-earned reputation, for Dr. Finley would travel many miles by horseback to attend to patients in surrounding areas and would even help with household chores before getting back on the saddle and traveling to another patient in need. He and his wife were very active within the Dubuque community, belonging to the early settlers group, helping to organize the Presbyterian Church, and forming the Northwest Medical Society (currently known as the Dubuque County Medical Society.) Dr. Finley always wanted to establish a medical school and a hospital. Unfortunately, his efforts to do so were unsuccessful and he eventually died before he could see his dreams come to fruition. Helen helped to honor one of her deceased husband's two wishes. In her will and testament, she specified that her estate should be used to found a hospital in Dubuque named after her husband.

It was discovered on 5 October 1997, by Czech astronomer Zdeněk Moravec at the South Bohemian Kleť Observatory in the Czech Republic. The dark C-type asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,091 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was made at the Japanese Kiso Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 20 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in December 2012. It gave it a rotation period of 4.4692±0.0019 hours with a brightness variation of 0.24 in magnitude (U=2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 12.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.097, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.08 and calculates a diameter of 7.9 kilometers.

Prior to mining operations commencing there, the mountains were heavily forested with large Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii glauca) and other conifers, but these were all cut down for housing needs and to feed the ore smelting furnaces in Douglas, Arizona, approximately 20 miles due east. Now, the primary vegetation of the Mules consists of manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) brush, juniper, lowland oaks and pines, and various grasses. To the east of the mountain range lies Sulphur Springs Valley, and the San Pedro River and Valley to the west. The terrain is very rough, with very steep slopes descending into deep canyons. Common wildlife species include Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), White-tailed deer (O. virginianus), Collared Peccary (Pecari tajacu) (locally known as javalinas), various types of rodents, lizards and a wide variety of birds. The upper ridges of the mountains consist primarily of a very hard brecciate limestone, and it is very common to find fossils of clams and snails imbedded in them. Immediately to the east central area of the Mules lies the Lavender Pit, a large and very deep open pit copper mine dug and mined by the Phelps Dodge Corporation between 1951 through 1974. Over a billion tons of copper were extracted from the mine, along with significant quantities gold, silver and lead. Also, as a by-product of the mining operations, high quality turquoise (locally known as Bisbee Blue) was also discovered. On the east central slope of the Mule Mountains can be found the Copper Queen Mine. In its days of production, (late 19th century – early 20th century) it was the richest copper deposit ever discovered, causing the accompanying town of Bisbee, Arizona to prosper, becoming the largest city between St. Louis in the east, and San Francisco in the west for a short while. Under this part of the Mule Mountains are many mining tunnels dug in pursuit of the rich copper ore. Today, Bisbee (also known as the \""mile-high city,\"" at elevation 5,300 ft or 1,600 m) is largely a tourist town and retirement community along the slopes of Tombstone Canyon in the heart of the Mules.

NICER will enable rotation-resolved spectroscopy of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2–12 keV) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known. NICER will achieve these goals by deploying, following launch, an X-ray timing and spectroscopy instrument as an attached payload aboard the International Space Station (ISS). NICER was selected by NASA to proceed to formulation phase in April 2013. An enhancement to the NICER mission, the Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology (SEXTANT), will act as a technology demonstrator for X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV) techniques that may one day be used for deep-space navigation. As of May 2015, NICER was on track for a 2016 launch, having passed its critical design review and resolved an issue with the power being supplied by the ISS.

The bridge's design, which lacked shoulders for disabled or wrecked vehicles to pull out of the flow of traffic, made it a severe bottleneck for commuters going to the Orlando Area beginning in the 1980s. A series of fatal traffic collisions on it and similarly-designed bridges statewide, most notably the Interstate 75 Lake Panasoffkee Bridge, led to a move in 2000 to use state emergency bridge funds similar to the contingency funds used to rebuild the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to begin planned reconstruction.

The lake area covers 4,370 hectares, and its depth reaches 196 meters, making it one of the deeper lakes in Turkey, if not the deepest. It is a popular excursion spot across the region or from beyond, the more so due to the hydromagnesite mineral found along its coasts which are believed to offer remedies for certain dermatological diseases. The shoreline surrounded by black pine forests are also popular among hunters, the game and the fowl available including quails, hares, foxes, boars and wild ducks, aside from the lake's fish. White sandy beaches, limpid water and seven crystal-white islets within the lake complete the scenery.

Located in the Goose Hollow neighborhood, the tunnels pass through a hillside locally known as Vista Ridge which is a half mile (1 km) west of downtown Portland. Sunset Highway, also known as U.S. Route 26, is carried through the tunnels, three lanes in each direction. They are Oregon's busiest tunnels. The eastbound tunnel is 1001.0 feet (305 m) in length; the westbound tunnel is 949 feet (289 m). Both have 41 ft (12.5 m) of horizontal and 15.58 ft (4.75 m) of vertical clearance. The eastbound tunnel was completed in 1969, the westbound a year later. There is a six-percent grade through the tunnels. Most of the tunnels' lengths are straight, though they curve southward at the west ends 35°. The tunnels were built with ventilation shafts which were never used. Instead, the shafts were later adapted for electrical wiring, so as to improve tunnel illumination without marring the tunnels' appearance with visible conduit. To improve tunnel safety for motorists, and decrease the tunnel lighting requirements, the original tunnel entrance faces were sandblasted to remove white paint and repainted a less luminescent tan color to reduce the range of visual light adaptation required by drivers. At one time there were computer-based electronic light controls, but they were replaced by relatively simple photo detectors and relays for durability and simplicity. The night lighting level is enabled permanently and is supplemented by two or three levels of daytime lighting. Except directly over the tunnels, the hillsides are steep and undeveloped forest, with some residential development along the top of the ridges. Landslides occasionally occur, but are usually minor and quickly cleared.

153054,"1868 Thersites, provisional designation 2008 P-L, is a carbonaceous Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately 70 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch-American astronomer Tom Gehrels at the U.S. Palomar Observatory, California, on 24 September 1960. On the same day, the group discovered another Jupiter trojan, 1869 Philoctetes. The dark C-type asteroid is orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.9 AU once every 12.27 years (4,482 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 17° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 6 years prior to its discovery. In 1994, photometric observations of this asteroid were made by Stefano Mottola at ESO's La Silla Observatory, Chile, using the Dutch 0.9-metre Telescope. The observations were used to build a light-curve showing a rotation period of 10.416±0.014 hours with a brightness variation of 0.14±0.01 magnitude (U=2+). According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid's diameter measures 78.9 and 68.2 kilometers, respectively, with a low albedo of 0.055 for its surface. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057, and calculates a shorter diameter of 66.9 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 9.6. The provisional survey designation \""P-L\"" stands for Palomar–Leiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s and 1970s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Cornelis and Ingrid van Houten at Leiden Observatory, where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of 4,620 minor planets. The Trojan asteroid is named from Greek mythology after Thersites, a Greek warrior who wanted to abandon Troy's siege during the Trojan War and head home. The given name also refers to the fact, that the asteroid was discovered farthest from the L4 Lagrangian point.

In 1973, their debut album \""See See The Sun\"" was released, including three hit singles. Their main popularity was in the Netherlands, with their top hit (Ruthless Queen) reaching No. 6 on the Dutch charts in March 1979. They disbanded in 1982 after releasing nine albums. In 1999 the band was asked to perform on the TV show De Vrienden van Amstel Live. After this performance, they decided to reform, and released seven further studio albums and three live albums. On 4 January 2008 they released Coming Up For Air. That same day saw the start of their 35th anniversary-tour. On 7 October 2008, they ended the tour at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was released on CD and DVD as The Anniversary Box in December 2008. In October 2009 the band embarked on a Dutch tour. According to Ton Scherpenzeel (on the band's website), after that tour Kayak would no longer do the album-tour-album-tour cycle. They would probably keep on making new music though, as Scherpenzeel stated. But the sudden and unexpected death of Pim Koopman in November 2009 (halfway through the tour) made the future of the band very uncertain. In May 2010, the band's website announced a tribute concert for Pim Koopman. The concert was held on 22 November at the Paradiso. It involved not only Kayak, but also some artists with whom Koopman had worked in the past. Some of the names that appeared on stage: Pussycat, Caren Maywood, Alides Hidding, José Hoebee and Michael Robinson. Okkie Huysdens (with whom Koopman formed The President) and Jeroen Engelbert (one of many members of Koopman's band Diesel) also performed. For the occasion, Kayak used Hans Voerman as an extra keyboard player. The drumstool was occupied by Hans Eijkenaar. After the concert, Kayak announced that Eijkenaar was the new drummer of Kayak. With Eijkenaar on drums, Kayak released their album Anywhere But Here in September 2011. On 21 September 2012, it was exactly 40 years ago that the band's name was chosen. To celebrate this, Kayak went on a tour titled Journey through Time, after one of their songs. They played at least one song from each studio album. Also included was an excerpt from their forthcoming album Cleopatra - The Crown Of Isis. That excerpt was also released on an EP, backed by a newly recorded version of Symmetry, a song that Scherpenzeel and Koopman originally wrote in 1971. The album Cleopatra - The Crown Of Isis was released in November 2014. At the end of 2014, Cindy Oudshoorn and Edward Reekers announced their departure from Kayak, leaving the band without lead vocalists.

The station callsign and branding was later changed to 2ZG. In 1978 2ZG moved to 945AM, the change in frequency was due to the New Zealand AM band changing from 10 kHz frequency spacing to 9 kHz spacing.

Known for innovations in his office, Fuselier was the sheriff from 1980 until c. 2003, when he resigned prior to the nonpartisan blanket primary for what would have been his seventh term. Fuselier's father, Charles J. Fuselier, was the sheriff prior to 1978, when he died in office. Fuselier was elected sheriff in 1979 and took office in the summer of 1980, after the two-year interim period of Sheriff Allan B. Durand (1919–2006). Durand had been chief deputy under the first Sheriff Fuselier and continued thereafter as first deputy under Charles A. Fuselier until Durand's retirement. He was reelected in 1983 with more than 86 percent of the ballots cast. In his last contested re-election in 1995, Fuselier polled more than 65 percent of the vote over three opponents. He was succeeded by Ronald J. \""Ronny\"" Theriot (born 1946), an Independent and former major with the Louisiana State Police, who assumed the office on October 16, 2003. In 1983, Fuselier oversaw the completion of a new jail; in 1990, the installation of a parish-wide 911 system; in 1991, the creation of a sheriff's substation, and in 1995, the construction of a facility for juveniles. In 1996, he received the National Sheriff of the Year award, an honor for which he expressed \""shock\"". Then U.S. Representative Jimmy Hayes of Louisiana's 7th congressional district, since disbanded, honored Fuselier in a speech delivered on the floor of Congress. In his address, Hayes noted that Fuselier initiated a local partnership between the sheriff's office, the St. Martinville chief of police, and the American Association of Retired Persons to create the first TRIAD program in St. Martin Parish, which works to prevent crimes against senior citizens. In 1999, the St. Martin Parish sheriff's office under Fuselier became the first in Louisiana to receive the imprint of the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. Though Fuselier's political career occurred while he was a Democrat, the office of Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler lists Fuselier and his wife, the former Lyndahl Hobgood (born June 1943), as Republican voters, as of December 2013.

Thereafter, as sheriff he was heavily involved in the promotion of 4-H programs. In 1981, he established the Charles Fuselier Livestock Award, named for his father, and the subsequent Charles Fuselier Scholarship in 2002. In 2008, he was inducted into the 4-H Hall of Fame, housed in a museum in Avoyelles Parish south of Alexandria. In 2003, Fuselier was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

Derived from the Co-operative Resources Centre in 1993, the Liberal Party was founded by a group of conservative politicians, businessmen and professionals who were appointed by the colonial governor or elected through trade-based functional constituencies to counter the rise of the pro-democracy camp elected through the the first ever direct election in 1991 to the legislature. The Liberal Party aligned to the Beijing government in the last years of the colonial rule and remained one of the largest parties with the pro-democracy Democratic Party and the Beijing-loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) in the first decade of the SAR period through the business sectors of the functional constituencies with restricted electorates.

He was an assistant coach at his alma mater under Gary Williams from 2004 to 2011. He is currently an assistant coach for G.G. Smith with the Loyola University Maryland men's basketball team. Booth was born and raised in Baltimore and attended Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. Heavily recruited by coach Gary Williams, he was the first player from Baltimore City in several years to play for Maryland. After the resignation of Williams' predecessor, Bob Wade, due to NCAA violations, a de facto boycott of the university was put in place by the high-school coaches in Baltimore. Because of this boycott, many star high-school players avoided Maryland as a choice to play their college ball. In becoming one of the members of Maryland's 1993 recruiting class, Booth broke the ice, and the school once again had access to talent-rich Baltimore City. Booth was a 1993 McDonald's All-American. Booth was the Chicago Bulls' first-pick (28th overall) in the 1997 NBA Draft, and he played two seasons with the Bulls. Booth later returned to the Maryland campus and earned a bachelor's degree in criminology and criminal justice in 2003. After getting his degree, he worked at the Park School of Baltimore in Brooklandville, Maryland, where he was the middle school baseball coach. He also volunteered at an after-school program at his former high school, Dunbar. In 2004, he returned to his alma mater to become an assistant under Williams. He organized recruiting as well as promoting and directing the Gary Williams Summer Basketball Camp each Summer in College Park. After Williams' retirement in 2011, Booth left Maryland when incoming head coach Mark Turgeon chose not to retain him. In October 2011, Booth was named an assistant women's basketball coach at Loyola University Maryland.

Bradshaw made his debut in the 2008 Championship, against Roscommon in the Connacht SFC 1st Round clash. He was one of four debutants introduced by manager Liam Sammon.

This ceremony has subsequently become an identifying feature of the Dhammakaya Movement. Thongsuk Samdaengpan was born on 1 August 1900 at Baan Saphan Lueang, Bangrak District, Bangkok. She was the third born to her father Rom and mother Wan. She was separated from her parents at an early age, being adopted by her uncle and aunt instead. She had no formal education and was illiterate. She married Dr. Chin Samdaengpan, a surgeon at Chulalongkorn Hospital. They had two children together before the untimely death of her husband - from which time onwards, Thongsuk Samdaengpan had to support herself and her children working as a salesperson. In 1930, Thongsuk Samdaengpan started to study meditation at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen under the instruction of Luang Pu Sodh using the Dhammakaya Meditation method, being able to attain the Dhammakaya by 1935. She was accepted as an advanced pracitioner in Luang Pu Sodh's \""meditation factory\"" (Thai: \""โรงงานทำวิชชา\""), while being authorized to teach meditation outside the temple in Bangkok households, such as that of Liap Sikanchananand. In 1936 she accepted Chandra Khonnokyoong as her student. In 1938, she went on a one-month meditation retreat at Wat Paknam, at the end of which she renounced the worldly life together with Chandra Khonnokyoong and both ordained as maechi at Wat Paknam. Thongsuk Samdaengpan became an exceptionally gifted Dhamma teacher, answering questions in a way that was easy to understand and helping meditators overcome hindrances. She travelled around Thailand to spread the Dhamma and teach Dhammakaya Meditation according to the policy of Luang Pu Sodh – sometimes accompanied by Mae Ji Thean Theerawat, sometimes by Chandra Khonnokyoong. She had occasion to teach in eighteen provinces which included Nakhon Pathom, Ratchaburi, Sing Buri, Chachoengsao, Chonburi, Prachinburi, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok  and was therefore notable as one of the leading teachers of Buddhism in Thailand at that time.

Carp (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈpetre pe karp]; also Petrache Carp, Francized Pierre Carp, occasionally Comte Carpe; June 28 or 29, 1837 – June 19, 1919) was a Moldavian, later Romanian statesman, political scientist and culture critic, one of the major representatives of Romanian liberal conservatism, and twice the country's Prime Minister (1900–1901, 1910–1912). His youth was intertwined with the activity of Junimea club, which he co-founded with critic Titu Maiorescu as a literary society, and then helped transform it into a political club. He left behind a budding career as Junimea's polemicist and cultural journalist, joining the state bureaucracy of the United Principalities, the Romanian diplomatic corps, and ultimately electoral politics. A speaker for aristocratic sentiment and the Romanian gentry, Carp helped create the Conservative Party from the various \""White\"" conservative clubs (1880), but also led a Junimist dissident wing against the Conservative mainstream leaders Lascăr Catargiu and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. He was a contributor to the Junimea platform Convorbiri Literare, and founder of the newspapers Térra (1868) and Moldova (1915). Widely seen as unyielding and trenchant in his public stance, and respected as an orator, P. P. Carp stood against the majority current in various political debates. His entire discourse was an alternative to the protectionist, antisemitic and populist tendencies of \""Red\"" Romanian liberalism. Welcoming Westernization and free trade, his vision of development nonetheless rested on gradualism and criticized modern experiments in governance. The two Carp administrations are remembered for their fiscal reforms, their encouragement of foreign investments, and their attempted clampdown on political corruption. A Germanophile and a Russophobe, Carp gathered consensus for steering the Kingdom of Romania into the Triple Alliance, but his external policy became entirely unpopular by the start of World War I. During that time, he was the only prominent public figure to demand a declaration of war against the Entente Powers. He came out of retirement during the German occupation of Romania, when he inspired fellow Conservative Lupu Kostaki to set up a collaborationist territorial government. This final project caused his fall into disgrace once the legitimate government regained control.",Agent,Politician,PrimeMinister,Petre_P._Carp,348

All three Chinese emperors confirmed the heqin 和親 peace and kinship treaty with the Huns, pledging to live by its terms. The treaty generally held during the reign of Gunchen Chanyu, however, the Chinese annals note that the mutual relations were imperiled on a number of occasions, which included appeals of the Chinese contenders for the Xiong Gnu's assistance and protection, the Xiong Gnu's retaliatory raids as punishments for violation of the treaty terms, and one direct Chinese assault against the Chanyu. The Huns were especially sensitive about unimperiled trade relations, which were one of the terms of the heqin treaty, and the Chinese annals specifically note a number of instances of the border trade opening, implying that the border trade was at times banned. The ambush happened in the 133 BCE, when Gunchen Chanyu was lured inside the border, and he almost run into an ambush of a 300,000 strong Chinese army. Only a disclosure by a Chinese officer about the planned ambush saved the Chanyu.

310998,"The Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) Party is an Australian political party which advocates the legalisation of cannabis. The group was founded in 1993 by Nigel Quinlan, who ran as a candidate under the name Nigel Freemarijuana. In 2001, Freemarijuana's name was assessed by the Australian Electoral Commission as to whether it was suitable to be added to the electoral roll – the Commission found that it was, meaning Freemarijuana could run as an electoral candidate under the name. HEMP is based in Nimbin, New South Wales, the centre of Australia's cannabis culture. HEMP has unsuccessfully stood candidates in several federal and state elections, but has struggled to maintain the membership and regulatory requirements for party registration in Australia. In 2007, prior to the 2007 federal election, HEMP was de-registered as a political party by the Australian Electoral Commission after a random audit of its membership. The group re-applied for party registration in February 2010, but according to HEMP secretary Graham Askey, delays in processing their application meant that registration did not proceed in time before the 2010 federal election was called. It was formally registered on 23 September 2010. The party received a nationwide Senate vote of 0.71 percent at the 2013 federal election. Historically the party's best result was at the 1994 Elizabeth by-election in South Australia with a 5.37 percent primary vote.

Listed at 5' 10\"", 175 lbs., he batted and threw right-handed. Christopher reached the majors in 1959 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, spending three years with them before moving to the New York Mets (1962–65) and Boston Red Sox (1966). While in Pittsburgh, Christopher was used as a backup in all three outfield positions for Bob Skinner (LF), Bill Virdon (CF) and Roberto Clemente (RF). He was first called up when Clemente was injured, making his debut in nothing less than Harvey Haddix’s pitching masterpiece of 12 perfect innings on May 26, 1959. As a member of the 1960 World Series Champion Pirates, he was a utility player, pinch-running in three games and scoring two runs (games 2 and 5). Christopher became the Mets’ fifth pick in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft. In 1964 he enjoyed easily his finest season as a major-leaguer, hitting .300 with 16 home runs, 76 RBI, 78 runs, 163 hits, 26 doubles, and eight triples in 154 games, all career-highs. He had a career-best day on August 19, collecting two triples, a double, and a home run in an 8–6 victory over his former Pirates teammates. Then, on September 25 he broke up the no-hit bid of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Jim Maloney at Shea Stadium. His second-inning single was the only hit against Maloney, who had to settle for a 3–0 shutout. Christopher played briefly in 1966 for the Red Sox and was dealt with pitcher Earl Wilson to the Detroit Tigers, who sent Julio Navarro as part of the package. Although Christopher’s major league career had come to an end on June 9, 1966 (he never played for Detroit), he stayed active in the minors through 1968. He also played winter baseball in Dominican Republic, Mexico and Puerto Rico.

313447,"Eggstone is a Swedish Indie Pop band, formed in 1986. The three members - Per Sunding (vocals, bass), Patrik Bartosch (guitar) and Maurits Carlsson (drums) - were raised in the small coastal town of Lomma, outside Malmö. In 1991 they formed Tambourine Studios in Malmö with friends Anders Nordgren and producer Tore Johansson. Their debut album Eggstone In San Diego was released in 1992, followed by Somersault two years later. In early 1997, they released Vive La Différence!, their third full-length album, on their own (and now defunct) Vibrafon label. Spanish Slalom, a compilation album, was released on Madrid-based Siesta Records in 1998 and a second compilation appeared in 1999 under the Tricatel label, titled Ca Chauffe en Suède!. Eggstone's songs, light and poppy on the surface, disguise great subtlety in their conception and execution. The trio delights in strange shifts of tempo, harmonic clashes and pseudo-amateurish incidental noises, whilst retaining an easy seductiveness for untrained ears. All three members are accomplished musicians; Bartosch in particular who has developed a guitar style entirely his own, both faux-naïf and virtuosic. A fourth album has reportedly been in preparation since the late 1990s, with some sessions taking place under the tutelage of Tricatel owner/in-house producer Bertrand Burgalat. Per Sunding's work as an in-demand producer in his home country and Patrick Bartosch's taste for foreign trips have unfortunately prevented the band from doing more than teasing fans. Eggstone's lack of large-scale commercial success is all the more surprising since the trio was the inspiration and, to some extent, the template for a number of internationally successful Swedish Indie Pop acts such as Cinnamon and The Cardigans.

209140,"Herbert Montandon \""Monty\"" Garland-Wells (14 November 1907 – 6 June 1993) was an English amateur cricketer. His first-class career, first with Oxford University and then with Surrey, lasted from 1927 until 1939, being terminated by the outbreak of World War II . He was a middle-order batsman and a bowler of medium-pace cutters. He captained Surrey in his final season. He was also a good enough footballer to play for the England amateur team in one match in 1930 as the goalkeeper. He played 11 games in the Football League for Clapton Orient. He was educated at St Paul's, before going up to Oxford. He was not selected to play for Oxford in the University Match against Cambridge University in 1927, but did so in 1928 (when he made 64 not out and 70), 1929 and 1930. 1928 was easily his best season with the bat. He reached one thousand runs for the only time, with 1270 at an average of 43.79. He also made two of his four centuries, including his highest score of 128. After his university days, his batting declined. Even so, he, Errol Holmes and Freddie Brown, three amateurs of aggressive intent who often followed one another in the batting order, were referred to at Surrey as the \""Biff-Bang Boys\"". His most memorable moment with the ball was to bowl Don Bradman for 32 in 1930 when he was en route to his thousand runs in May. Under his captaincy in 1939, Surrey made an excellent start, but then faded to finish eighth, having been third the previous season. Nevertheless his Wisden obituary is complimentary about his leadership. He is described as displaying \""a touch of unorthodoxy in the tradition of Percy Fender\"". He was liked by the professional players, showing no sign of any amateur aloofness. According to David Lemmon, he wrote: \""For myself, I loved every moment of 1939 and other years when I played for Surrey.\"" At the end of the season, the war began, and his career as a solicitor prevented him from resuming in 1946. Thereafter his main sports were golf and bowls. According to Wisden:During the war his name was informally used as a code word in North Africa: Garland-Wells = Monty = Montgomery. This was more impenetrable to the Germans than the most complicated cipher.",Agent,Athlete,Cricketer,Monty_Garland-Wells,386

It was established in 1965, in the capital Puerto Princesa City, by Ramon Oliveros (Ray Oliver) Decolongon. The station faced many difficulties in its early years. Although Palawan could receive some broadcasts from Manila and neighbouring Visayan islands, radio ownership among the 20,000-strong population was not high. The Tinio Electric Plant provided electricity only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and to less than half the population. Then, in 1966, Decolongon was killed in a plane crash: his father, Emilio Decolongon, took over as company president. In September 1972 martial law was declared throughout the Philippines and all broadcasting stations were shut down, but DYPR was able to reopen fairly quickly after making its case as a provider of essential services. The station had become a part of the communications of the island, broadcasting urgent personal messages—known as Panawagans—as a free service to the community.

His exact place of birth is unknown but has been identified as Ypsicron (present-day Cirò). Nicodemus’ parents were named Theophanus and Pandia, and they entrusted their son's spiritual education to a priest named Galato (Galatone). Early on, Nicodemus was attracted to the monastic life, and wished to join the ascetics who had established themselves in the zone known as the Mercurion, on the cliffs of the Pollino in Calabria. He was at first refused entry into the community by the austere abbot Saint Fantinus (Fantino), who did not think Nicodemus could endure the penances and mortifications, but eventually the abbot relented. The reputation for holiness and austerity of these Calabrian monks, whose number included Saint Nilus of Rossano (San Nilo di Rossano), was such that they received praised by Orestes, patriarch of Jerusalem. Eventually, Nicodemus withdrew to Mount Cellerano (or Kellerano, today San Nicodemo) in the area known as Locride, where his fame attracted a new community of monks there. This community was threatened by Muslim raids, and so Nicodemus relocated to Gerace and thence to Mammola, where a monastery was later established.

Raymond Kennedy (born 28 July 1951) is an English former footballer who won every domestic honour in the game with Arsenal and Liverpool in the 1970s and early 1980s. Kennedy played as a forward for Arsenal, and then played as a left-sided midfielder for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the Football League, and also won 17 caps for England between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals. Born and raised in former pit village Seaton Delaval, he spent a year at Port Vale as a schoolboy, before returning to Northumberland to work in a sweet factory after he was released at the age of 16. He was then spotted playing for New Hartley Juniors by Arsenal, and went on to turn professional at the club in November 1968. He made his first team debut ten months later, and went on to win the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, the First Division and FA Cup Double in 1970–71, and then play on the losing side in the 1972 FA Cup Final. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record £200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that Bill Shankly resigned as manager. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager Bob Paisley converted him to a left-sided midfielder he went on to help Liverpool to become the dominant club of English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, and 1981–82), the FA Charity Shield four times (1976, 1977, 1979, and 1980), the European Cup three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the UEFA Cup (1976), UEFA Super Cup (1977), and League Cup (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1981), and World Club Championship (1981), and won the Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award in 1977–78. He joined Swansea City for a £160,000 fee in January 1982, and added a Welsh Cup winners medal to his collection four months later. However the effects of Parkinson's disease began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he dropped into the Fourth Division with Hartlepool United in November 1983. During the 1984–85 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of Cyprus club Pezoporikos and later played for Northern League club Ashington. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was tough, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993. He was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder during his time at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the England under-23 side he was unable to translate his club form into a good international career, and was used as a stand-in for Trevor Brooking before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981.

He was a left-handed pitcher over parts of six seasons in Major League Baseball (1974–79) with the Cincinnati Reds, Montreal Expos, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals. McEnaney was one of five children of William and Eleanor (Grieb) McEnaney and attended Springfield North High School in Springfield, Ohio. He was drafted by the Reds in the eighth round of the 1970 amateur draft. He made his Major League debut at age 22 on July 3, 1974 in relief of starter Clay Carroll in a 4–1 Reds loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium. McEnaney's first-ever inning was a 1–2–3 one as he induced popouts from Tommy John, Davey Lopes and Bill Buckner, and for the game he pitched two scoreless innings. In his rookie season, he pitched 24 games, with a 2–1 record and a 4.44 earned run average. McEnaney was a key member of the bullpen of the 1975 and 1976 World Series champions Big Red Machine. In 1975, he posted a 5–2 record with a 2.47 ERA and 15 saves in 70 pitching appearances, but he is best known for his performance in the Series, in which he pitched five games (6.2 innings) in relief with a 2.70 ERA and one save, moreover for his exploits in the deciding Game 7. Entering in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the Reds clinging to a 4–3 lead over the Boston Red Sox, McEnaney got Juan Beníquez to fly out followed by a Bob Montgomery groundout. He then sealed the World Series title and became part of an iconic Reds moment as he induced Carl Yastrzemski to hit a flyball to centerfield, which was grabbed by César Gerónimo, followed by McEnaney's teammates swarming him and celebrating around the pitcher's mound. In 1976 he fell to 2–6 with a 4.85 ERA in 55 games. But he again excelled in the World Series, pitching 4.2 scoreless innings in two games and earning two saves. And, just as in the previous World Series, he closed out the series with a 1–2–3 ninth inning, only this time it was for a four-game sweep over the New York Yankees. In December 1976 he was traded to the Expos, for whom in 1977 he pitched 69 games with a 3–5 record and a 3.95 ERA. He was then traded to the Pirates shortly before the 1978 season and pitched only six games with a 10.38 ERA. Released by the Pirates, he played for the Cardinals in 1979. In that season he pitched in 25 games with an 0–3 record and a fine 2.95 ERA, but it was his final season in the majors as the Cardinals released him just prior to the 1980 season. For his Major League career he compiled 12–17 record with a 3.76 earned run average and 148 strikeouts in 269 appearances, all as a relief pitcher. Besides, McEnaney played in Mexico with the Águilas de Mexicali and the Plataneros de Tabasco, as well as for the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association. In 1980, while pitching for Mexicali, McEnaney hurled a 1–0 no-hitter against the Algodoneros de Guasave. McEnaney lives in Florida with his second wife, Cindy, and they have two grown sons. He also has a daughter from his first marriage.

Fountain was the first baseball player to be used as a Specialist Fielding Coach by any test level cricket team when he was hired in 1998 by the West Indies to coach on their tour of South Africa. On the 2000/01 West Indies tour of Australia he took to the field as substitute fielder for the West Indies against the Prime Ministers eleven at the Manuka Oval in Canberra. He rose to the challenge by running out Anthony McQuire with a direct hit from the boundary.He has acted as Substitute Fielder (12th Man) a total of four times for both West Indies in 2001& 2007 and Pakistan in 2013.
